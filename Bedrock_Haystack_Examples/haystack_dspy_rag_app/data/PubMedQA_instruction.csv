Do cC and CXC chemokine levels in children with meningococcal sepsis accurately predict mortality and disease severity?,"Chemokines are a superfamily of small peptides involved in leukocyte chemotaxis and in the induction of cytokines in a wide range of infectious diseases. Little is known about their role in meningococcal sepsis in children and their relationship with disease severity and outcome. Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1alpha, growth-related gene product (GRO)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 were measured in 58 children with meningococcal sepsis or septic shock on admission and 24 hours thereafter. Nine patients died. Serum chemokine levels of survivors and nonsurvivors were compared, and the chemokine levels were correlated with prognostic disease severity scores and various laboratory parameters. Extremely high levels of all chemokines were measured in the children's acute-phase sera. These levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors and in patients with septic shock compared with patients with sepsis (P < 0.0001). The cutoff values of 65,407 pg/ml, 85,427 pg/ml and 460 pg/ml for monocyte chemoattractant protein, for IL-8 and for macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, respectively, all had 100% sensitivity and 94-98% specificity for nonsurvival. Chemokine levels correlated better with disease outcome and severity than tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and correlated similarly to interleukin (IL)-6. In available samples 24 hours after admission, a dramatic decrease of chemokine levels was seen.",Initial-phase serum levels of chemokines in patients with meningococcal sepsis can predict mortality and can correlate strongly with disease severity. Chemokines may play a key role in the pathophysiology of meningococcal disease and are potentially new targets for therapeutic approaches.,closed_qa
Are sAH gene variants associated with obesity-related hypertension in Caucasians : the PEGASE Study?,"The SAH gene locus has recently been proposed to be involved in obesity-related hypertension in Japanese individuals. To replicate independently the initial findings in another ethnic group, we scanned the entire SAH gene in 190 Caucasian chromosomes. A total of 651 patients with essential hypertension and 776 controls (PEGASE Study) were genotyped for all identified variants using allele-specific oligonucleotides, and single nucleotide polymorphism as well as haplotype analyses were carried out. We also performed transient transfection experiments, northern and western blots, immunoprecipitation, and acyl-coenzyme A synthetase activity assays. We identified five polymorphisms in the promoter region (C-1808T, G-1606A, -962ins/del, G-451A, T-67C), two in introns 5 and 7 (T+9/In5C, A+20/In7T), and one missense variant (K359N). Carriage of the -1606A allele was significantly associated with hypertension [odds ratio (OR) 1.28, P = 0.049] as was 359N (OR 1.35, P = 0.048) compared with non-carriers. Conversely, for -962del, the OR for hypertension was 0.80 (P = 0.042). The SAH alleles -1606A and 359N, but not -962ins/del, displayed a raising effect on body mass index (BMI; P = 0.004 and P = 0.030, respectively) in hypertensive as well as in control individuals. After adjustment for BMI in hypertensive individuals, only the OR associated with -962ins/del remained significant (OR 0.77, P = 0.028). Functional analyses in BHK did not reveal differences for SAH 359N or 359K-containing constructs, formally excluding K359N as the functional variant.","We confirm recent evidence that the SAH locus is associated with obesity-related hypertension, in which pathophysiological context SAH variants affecting blood pressure remain, however, to be shown.",closed_qa
Do the functional anatomy of gaze-evoked tinnitus and sustained lateral gaze?,"To identify neural sites associated with gaze-evoked tinnitus (GET), an unusual condition that may follow cerebellar-pontine angle surgery. The authors examined eight patients with GET and used PET to map the neural sites activated by lateral gaze in them and seven age- and sex-matched control subjects. In patients with GET, tinnitus loudness and pitch increased with lateral gaze and, to a lesser extent, up and down gaze. Evidence for neural activity related to GET was seen in the auditory lateral pontine tegmentum or auditory cortex. GET-associated nystagmus appears to activate the cuneus and cerebellar vermis. These sites were found in addition to an extensive network that included frontal eye fields and other sites in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex that were activated by lateral gaze in seven control subjects and the patients. The unilateral deafness in patients with GET was associated with expansion of auditory cortical areas responsive to tones delivered to the good ear. In addition to GET, unilateral deafness, end-gaze nystagmus, and facial nerve dysfunction were common.","Patients with GET have plastic changes in multiple neural systems that allow neural activity associated with eye movement, including those associated with the neural integrator, to stimulate the auditory system. Anomalous auditory activation is enhanced by the failure of cross-modal inhibition to suppress auditory cortical activity. The time course for the development of GET suggests that it may be due to multiple mechanisms.",closed_qa
Does neighborhood fast-food outlet exposure amplify inequalities in diet and obesity?,"Greater exposures to fast-food outlets and lower levels of education are independently associated with less healthy diets and obesity. Little is known about the interplay between these environmental and individual factors. The purpose of this study was to test whether observed differences in fast-food consumption and obesity by fast-food outlet exposure are moderated by educational attainment. In a population-based cohort of 5958 adults aged 29-62 y in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom, we used educational attainment-stratified regression models to estimate the food-frequency questionnaire-derived consumption of energy-dense ""fast foods"" (g/d) typically sold in fast-food restaurants and measured body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) across geographic information system-derived home and work fast-food exposure quartiles. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds of obesity (BMI ≥30) and calculated relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) on an additive scale. Participant data were collected during 2005-2013 and analyzed in 2015. Greater fast-food consumption, BMI, and odds of obesity were associated with greater fast-food outlet exposure and a lower educational level. Fast-food consumption and BMI were significantly different across education groups at all levels of fast-food outlet exposure (P<0.05). High fast-food outlet exposure amplified differences in fast-food consumption across levels of education. The relation between fast-food outlet exposure and obesity was only significant among those who were least educated (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.87; RERI = 0.88), which suggested a positive additive interaction between education and fast-food outlet exposure.",These findings suggest that efforts to improve diets and health through neighborhood-level fast-food outlet regulation might be effective across socioeconomic groups and may serve to reduce observed socioeconomic inequalities in diet and obesity.,closed_qa
Does conditioned pain modulation predict exercise-induced hypoalgesia in healthy adults?,"Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is the concept that pain inhibits pain and has potential rehabilitation implications for exercise prescription. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in pressure pain perception after a thermal conditioning stimulus (i.e., CPM) was attenuated with aging and whether CPM predicted pain relief after exercise (exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH)) in healthy young and older adults. Twenty young (21.9 ± 3.3 yr, 10 men) and 19 older (72.0 ± 4.5 yr, 10 men) adults participated in three sessions: one familiarization and two experimental (EIH and CPM) sessions. Pressure pain perception was assessed using a weighted Lucite edge placed on the right index finger for 1 min. EIH was determined by measuring pressure pain perception before and after prolonged submaximal isometric contraction of the elbow flexors. CPM was assessed by measuring pressure pain perception at the finger while the foot was immersed in neutral water versus painful ice water. Young, but not older, adults reported a decrease in pressure pain at the finger while their foot was immersed in the ice water bath compared with the neutral bath (i.e., CPM, trial-age: P = 0.001). Pressure pain ratings decreased after exercise (P = 0.03) that was perceived as painful (peak arm pain, 7.0 ± 3.3) for both young and older adults. Regression analysis showed that after controlling for age and baseline pain, CPM predicted EIH (model adjusted R = 0.23, P = 0.007).","CPM was attenuated in older adults, as measured with a noxious pressure stimulus after a thermal conditioning stimulus, and adults with greater CPM were more likely to report greater EIH.",closed_qa
Does notch-1 promote breast cancer cells proliferation by regulating LncRNA GAS5?,"Notch signaling is indicated as novel therapeutic targets to prevent recurrence of breast cancer. LncRNAs were identified as downstream target of Notch pathway. However, the exact mechanisms involved in Notch signaling, lncRNAs and breast cancer remain to be explained. This original research aimed to determine the prognostic implications of Notch-1 for breast cancer, and explain mechanisms involved in regulation of lnRNA GAS5 by Notch-1, and identify the function of this mechanism on breast cancer. Thirty breast cancer patients were included from The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (China) since January 2006 in this study. The mRNA level by RT-PCR and protein level of Notch-1 by western blot in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were evaluated and 5-year survival analysis was applied to examine the significance of Notch-1. The levels of ten reported lncRNAs were determined by RT-PCR, and subsequently linear analysis was applied to analyze the relationship between these four unique lncRNAs and protein level of Notch-1, which identified the most relevant lncRNA GAS5 with Notch-1 in breast cancer. Subsequently, Notch1-siRNA was applied to influence the expression of Notch-1 in T47D, then the level of RSA5 was measured by RT-PCR, and CCK-8 assay was applied to measure the proliferation of T47D cells. High level of Notch-1 provided a poor prognosis in breast cancer. Interference of Notch-1 significantly suppressed proliferation of T47D cell (P < 0.05), and significantly increased the level of GAS5.",Notch-1 promotes breast cancer cells proliferation by regulating LncRNA GAS5.,closed_qa
Chronic osteomyelitis in childhood: is surgery always indicated?,"Presently, most children with chronic osteomyelitis undergo surgery with the inherent risk of damage to their growth plate. We demonstrate a treatment regimen based on imaging procedures focussing on antibiotics in order to reduce the rate of surgical interventions. We retrospectively evaluated all 11 patients with clinically suspected chronic osteomyelitis who were treated at our institution from 1989 to 1995. Patients underwent open biopsy and surgical treatment only if imaging procedures showed signs indistinguishable from malignancy, or if they were highly suggestive for the presence of pus, joint infection or osteonecrosis. The patients were followed up for a minimum of 3 years. All five patients treated solely with antibiotics recovered completely. Three patients were subjected to open biopsy and surgical treatment since they showed radiological signs indistinguishable from malignancy, and two patients due to pus or osteonecrosis. In follow-up, there was one relapse of chronic osteomyelitis 11 months after the first treatment course with surgery and antibiotics. One patient suffering from Ewing's sarcoma as detected by open biopsy was excluded.","Our diagnostic procedure was useful to reduce the rate of surgery. Surgical treatment of chronic osteomyelitis is not always neccessary especially in cases of missing necrosis, joint infection and abscess as demonstrated by the complete recovery of our patients treated solely with antibiotics.",closed_qa
Does exercise protect against articular cartilage degeneration in the hamster?,"It has been reported that osteoarthritis can occur in hamsters. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of exercise on the composition of articular cartilage and synovial fluid and on the development of cartilage degeneration in these animals. Young (2.5-month-old) group-housed hamsters were compared with 5.5-month-old hamsters that had undergone 3 months of daily wheel running exercise (6-12 km/day) or 3 months of sedentary, individually housed living. The condition of the femoral condyles was determined by scanning electron microscopy in 12 exercising hamsters, 12 sedentary hamsters, and 6 of the young controls. The content of proteoglycan, hyaluronic acid, hydroxyproline, and proline in synovial fluid and patellar cartilage was measured. By scanning electron microscopy, the femoral articular cartilage was smooth and undulating in young controls and older exercising hamsters. In contrast, the femoral condyles were fibrillated in all 12 of the sedentary hamsters. There was no difference in the patellar cartilage collagen content between the 3 groups, but proteoglycan content and synthesis were lower in the patellar cartilage of the sedentary group. Synovial fluid volume was also decreased in the sedentary group compared with the young controls or the older exercising hamsters.","A sedentary lifestyle in the hamster leads to a lower proteoglycan content in the cartilage and a lower synovial fluid volume. These changes are associated with cartilage fibrillation, pitting, and fissuring. Daily exercise prevents early cartilage degeneration and maintains normal articular cartilage.",closed_qa
Does bisoprolol/amlodipine combination therapy improve blood pressure control in patients with essential hypertension following monotherapy failure?,"The efficacy of a bisoprolol/amlodipine fixed-dose combination (FDC) in patients with essential hypertension who had not responded to bisoprolol or amlodipine monotherapy was investigated. In an 18 week, multicenter, randomized, comparative phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01977794), patients with blood pressure uncontrolled by bisoprolol or amlodipine monotherapy (5 mg OD) began treatment with bisoprolol/amlodipine FDC 5/5 mg OD. Patients with controlled blood pressure (BP) at week 6/12 continued at current FDC strength, and patients with uncontrolled BP received FDC dose uptitration (maximum dose: 10/10 mg). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at week 18 versus baseline (corresponding to SBP under monotherapy), and secondary endpoints included change from baseline in SBP after week 6/12 and percentage of BP-controlled patients at week 6, 12 and 18. Safety was assessed by number/types of adverse events (AEs). Two hundred patients were randomized to treatment (100 with uncontrolled BP under bisoprolol and 100 under amlodipine monotherapy). Overall, 196 patients were eligible for analysis. The patient groups displayed similar mean SBP reductions from baseline by study end (bisoprolol monotherapy failure: 25.9 ± 12.82 mmHg reduction; amlodipine monotherapy failure: 24.7 ± 11.67 mmHg reduction; p < 0.001 for both). Overall mean SBP decreased by 25.3 ± 12.25 mmHg (p < 0.001). Mean heart rate reductions were also observed (bisoprolol monotherapy failure: 6.6 ± 9.67 bpm reduction; amlodipine monotherapy failure: 11.5 ± 8.65 bpm reduction; p < 0.001 for both). Most patients (83.2%) displayed BP control with bisoprolol/amlodipine 5/5 mg at 6 weeks. Treatment was well tolerated at all dose levels; treatment-related AEs (mostly of mild/moderate intensity) were reported by 52.5% of patients, with no severe or serious treatment-related AEs reported. As the study focused on hypertension, total cardiovascular risk was not assessed.",Bisoprolol/amlodipine FDC therapy is associated with significant BP improvements in patients with essential hypertension following monotherapy failure.,closed_qa
Does global DNA hypomethylation occur in the early stages of intestinal type gastric carcinoma?,"Global DNA hypomethylation has been found in the premalignant stages of some neoplasms and has been implicated as an important factor for tumour progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether DNA hypomethylation occurs during the process of gastric carcinogenesis. Gastric specimens were obtained from 49 patients and histologically classified as: normal 10, superficial gastritis 14, chronic atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia 15, and intestinal type of gastric carcinoma 10. Global DNA methylation was assessed by incubating DNA with (3H)-S-adenosylmethionine and Sss1 methylase. A higher incorporation of (3H) methyl groups reflects a lower degree of intrinsic methylation. A graduated increase in (3H) methyl group incorporation into DNA was found over the range extending from normal gastric mucosa, to superficial gastritis and to chronic atrophic gastritis (136,556 (24,085) v 235,725 (38,636) v 400,998 (26,747 dpm/micrograms/DNA respectively; p = 0.0002). No further increase was found in specimens from patients with carcinoma. No differences were found between extent of DNA methylation in neoplastic or non-neoplastic mucosa from patients with gastric carcinoma. Hypomethylation of DNA increased substantially with severe atrophy (p = 0.01) or with type III intestinal metaplasia (p = 0.15).","Global DNA hypomethylation occurs in the early stages of gastric carcinogenesis, and it may be a novel biomarker of gastric neoplasia, useful in monitoring the response to chemopreventive agents.",closed_qa
Do postmenopausal women with osteoarthritis and osteoporosis show different ultrastructural characteristics of trabecular bone of the femoral head?,"Osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) are public health diseases affecting the quality of life of the elderly, and bring about a heavy burden to the society and family of patients. It has been debated whether or not there is an inverse relationship between these two disorders. To compare the exact difference in bone tissue structure between osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, we observed the ultrastructure of trabecular bone from the femoral heads using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A total of 15 femoral head specimens from postmenopausal women were collected during the procedures of total or hemi hip replacement (OP, n = 8; OA, n = 7). The morphologic structure of the trabecular bone, collagen fibers, resorption lacuna and osteoblasts were observed. Under SEM, osteoporotic trabeculae appeared to be thinning, tapering, breaking and perforating. A number of resorption lacunae of various shapes were seen on the surface of the trabeculum. The collagen fibers of lacuna were resorbed. On occasion, naked granular bone crystals could be found. In the OA group, the trabecular bone looked thick with integrated structure. Reticular and granular new bone could be found. The trabeculum was covered by well-arranged collagen fibers around the resorption lacuna. In the OP group, under TEM, marginal collagen fibers were observed to be aligned loosely with enlarged spaces. A few inactive osteoblasts and no inflammatory cells were seen. In the OA group, the collagen fibers inside the trabeculum were arranged in a dense manner with many active osteoblasts and inflammatory cells infiltrating the matrix.","We found significant differences in the trabecular bone, collagen fibers, lacunae and osteoblasts between postmenopausal women with OP and OA. These findings support the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between OP and OA.",closed_qa
Does tET1 regulate hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by acting as a co-activator?,"Hypoxia induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT, to promote cancer metastasis. In addition to transcriptional regulation mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors, HIFs, other epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, are utilized under hypoxia. However, whether DNA demethylation mediated by TET1, a DNA dioxygenase converting 5-methylcytosine, 5mC, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5hmC, plays a role in hypoxia-induced EMT is largely unknown. We show that TET1 regulates hypoxia-responsive gene expression. Hypoxia/HIF-2α regulates the expression of TET1. Knockdown of TET1 mitigates hypoxia-induced EMT. RNA sequencing and 5hmC sequencing identified the set of TET1-regulated genes. Cholesterol metabolic process genes are among the genes that showed high prevalence and statistical significance. We characterize one of the genes, INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1), to confirm its expression and the 5hmC levels in its promoter. Knockdown of INSIG1 also mitigates hypoxia-induced EMT. Finally, TET1 is shown to be a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with HIF-1α and HIF-2α to enhance their transactivation activity independent of its enzymatic activity. TET1 acts as a co-activator to further enhance the expression of INSIG1 together with HIF-2α. We define the domain in HIF-1α that interacts with TET1 and map the domain in TET1 that confers transactivation to a 200 amino acid region that contains a CXXC domain. The TET1 catalytically inactive mutant is capable of rescuing hypoxia-induced EMT in TET1 knockdown cells.","These findings demonstrate that TET1 serves as a transcription co-activator to regulate hypoxia-responsive gene expression and EMT, in addition to its role in demethylating 5mC.",closed_qa
Is prophylactic atropine necessary during ketamine sedation in children?,"This was a retrospective study based on paediatric patients who received ketamine for procedures done at the children's emergency department from July 2010 to September 2010. Patients who were given atropine were compared with patients who were not given atropine with regard to clinically significant hypersalivation. All other side effects of ketamine (airway, respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects) were documented. Two out of the 164 (1.2%) patients who received atropine and 1 out of the 119 (0.8%) patients who did not receive atropine had desaturation (odds ratio (OR) 1.5; 95% CI 0.1-16.3). These three patients were all under 5 years old (P = 0.3) and had airway malalignment requiring repositioning. None had hypersalivation requiring intervention. Two out of 164 (1.2%) who received atropine and 3 out of 119 (2.5%) who did not receive atropine had vomiting (OR 0.5; CI 0.1-2.9). One patient who vomited did not receive atropine and was given ondansetron. The others had delayed discharges following a longer period of observation in the unit.","There was no clinically significant hypersalivation in children given ketamine sedation, with or without the coadministration of atropine. Ketamine is a relatively safe drug for use in children with few intervention-based side effects.",closed_qa
Is it feasible to merge data from national shoulder registries?,"The Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association was initiated in 2007, and several papers about hip and knee arthroplasty have been published. Inspired by this, we aimed to examine the feasibility of merging data from the Nordic national shoulder arthroplasty registries by defining a common minimal data set. A group of surgeons met in 2014 to discuss the feasibility of merging data from the national shoulder registries in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Differences in organization, definitions, variables, and outcome measures were discussed. A common minimal data set was defined as a set of variables containing only data that all registries could deliver and where consensus according to definition of the variables could be made. We agreed on a data set containing patient-related data (age, gender, and diagnosis), operative data (date, arthroplasty type and brand), and data in case of revision (date, reason for revision, and new arthroplasty brand). From 2004 to 2013, there were 19,857 primary arthroplasties reported. The most common indications were osteoarthritis (35%) and acute fracture (34%). The number of arthroplasties and especially the number of arthroplasties for osteoarthritis have increased in the study period. The most common arthroplasty type was total shoulder arthroplasty (34%) for osteoarthritis and stemmed hemiarthroplasty (90%) for acute fractures.","We were able to merge data from the Nordic national registries into 1 common data set; however, the set of details was reduced. We found considerable differences between the 3 countries regarding incidence of shoulder arthroplasty, age, diagnoses, and choice of arthroplasty type and brand.",closed_qa
Is laparoscopic radical trachelectomy an alternative to laparotomy with improved perioperative outcomes in patients with early-stage cervical cancer?,"Radical trachelectomy is an established surgical approach for managing young women with cervical cancer wishing to preserve fertility. The aim of this study was to compare perioperative outcomes between laparoscopic (LRT) and abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART). We reviewed the records of all women undergoing either LRT or ART in our institution since 2004. Demographic data, clinicopathologic data, and perioperative outcomes were collected and compared between the 2 procedures. Overall, 27 women were identified. All of them had stage IB1 disease. Eleven (40.8%) women underwent LRT, whereas 16 (59.2%) women underwent ART. Age, parity, and body mass index, as well as histologic type, grade, and presence of lymphovascular space invasion were comparable between groups. The median length of the parametrial tissue removed was shorter in LRT versus ART (P = 0.022). The median blood loss and length of stay were significantly reduced in the LRT group (85 vs 800 mL, P < 0.001; and 4 versus 7 days, P = 0.003). The median operative time was longer with the laparoscopic approach (320 versus 192.5 minutes, P < 0.001). Early grade 1 to 2 postoperative morbidity (mainly high urinary residuals) was comparable between groups; however, more grade 3 and late morbidity events were recorded in the ART group.","This first comparison study between LRT and ART for fertility preservation in women with cervical cancer shows that laparoscopy performed better in terms of blood loss and length of stay. Laparoscopic radical trachelectomy could be the preferred option for these patients; however, further studies are needed to confirm comparable survival outcomes.",closed_qa
Is phosphodiesterase type 5 upregulated by tadalafil in cultures of human penile cells?,"Tadalafil, a long-acting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, improves the erectile response by inhibiting cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) breakdown. Sustained higher levels of cGMP may hypothetically upregulate PDE5 expression and/or activity and lead to tachyphylaxis. We have investigated whether PDE5 upregulation occurs in vitro in cultures of human penile cells subjected to long-term incubation with increasing concentrations of tadalafil in the presence of a nitric oxide (NO) donor. Human corpora cavernosa smooth muscle cells (CSMC) and tunica albuginea fibroblasts (TAF) primary cultures were characterized by immunocytochemistry and Western blot, and incubated with graded concentrations of tadalafil for 14 days, adding S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) as an NO donor for the last 24 hours or at time zero, and cGMP levels were measured. Incubations were repeated for 7, 10, and 14 days, in the presence of SNAP, and PDE5 was estimated by Western blot, and at 14 days, by immunocytochemistry combined with quantitative image analysis, and by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Constructs of the human PDE5A promoter expressing luciferase were cloned and transfected into CSMC, and promoter activation by 8-deoxybromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) was measured by luminometry. Incubations of CSMC with SNAP and tadalafil up to 14 days did not upregulate PDE5 mRNA or protein levels. With TAF, PDE5 protein was also not upregulated despite a slight increase in mRNA levels. PDE5 enzyme activity was unaffected by tadalafil in either CSMC or TAF. No upregulation of the PDE5 promoter was observed with up to 2 mM 8-Br-cGMP.","Long-term incubation of human penile cells with tadalafil at concentrations above the in vitro IC50, and around the in vivo Cmax utilized in the clinical setting, did not upregulate PDE5A expression nor decrease cGMP levels. These data suggest that PDE5 upregulation is unlikely to occur in vivo on long-term tadalafil treatment.",closed_qa
Do bile acylcarnitine profiles in pediatric liver disease interfere with the diagnosis of long-chain fatty acid oxidation defects?,"Plasma acylcarnitine measurement is an important diagnostic tool for inherited disorders of fatty acid and organic acid metabolism. Biliary excretion has been shown to be the primary route of excretion for acylcarnitines and analysis of bile acylcarnitine profiles may provide greater sensitivity for detecting metabolic disorders. Disorders of fatty acid oxidation frequently present with deranged liver function and the effect of hepatic disease on biliary acylcarnitine excretion are unknown. We measured biliary acylcarnitine levels in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 1 year undergoing open liver biopsy with prospectively determined non-metabolic liver disease in order to determine the effect of the liver disease on acylcarnitine excretion. Bile was collected in syringes and was transported immediately and stored at -70 degrees C until the time of testing. The disease patient population consisted of 2 patients with known defects in long- and short-chain fatty acid oxidation (long-chain L-3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase: LCHAD and short-chain L-3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase: SCHAD). The sample from the LCHAD patient was collected at autopsy and the patient with SCHAD deficiency was subsequently diagnosed as part of the prospective study and removed from the unknown etiology group. Acylcarnitine profiles were obtained for each specimen as butylated derivatives using tandem mass spectrometry. The non-metabolic liver disease had no effect on the diagnostic value of bile acylcarnitine levels for detecting LCHAD deficiency. The concentrations of bile long-chain acylcarnitine species analyzed from patients with non-metabolic liver disease were far lower than the levels seen in LCHAD deficiency which also demonstrated a characteristic pattern of 3-hydroxyacylcarnitine excretion. In SCHAD deficiency, for which pathognomonic markers have not yet been established, bile analysis did not improve the diagnostic ability.",The analysis of bile acylcarnitines for the diagnosis of long-chain fatty acid oxidation defects will provide unbiased information even in the presence of severe non-metabolic liver disease.,closed_qa
Does the hippocampus play a selective role in the retrieval of detailed contextual memories?,"It is widely believed that the hippocampus plays a temporary role in the retrieval of episodic and contextual memories. Initial research indicated that damage to this structure produced amnesia for newly acquired memories but did not affect those formed in the distant past. A number of recent studies, however, have found that the hippocampus is required for the retrieval of episodic and contextual memories regardless of their age. These findings are currently the subject of intense debate, and a satisfying resolution has yet to be identified. The current experiments address this issue by demonstrating that detailed memories require the hippocampus, whereas memories that lose precision become independent of this structure. First, we show that the dorsal hippocampus is preferentially activated by the retrieval of detailed contextual fear memories. We then establish that the hippocampus is necessary for the retrieval of detailed memories by using a context-generalization procedure. Mice that exhibit high levels of generalization to a novel environment show no memory loss when the hippocampus is subsequently inactivated. In contrast, mice that discriminate between contexts are significantly impaired by hippocampus inactivation.","Our data suggest that detailed contextual memories require the hippocampus, whereas memories that lose precision can be retrieved without this structure. These findings can account for discrepancies in the literature-memories of our distant past can be either lost or retained after hippocampus damage depending on their quality-and provide a new framework for understanding memory consolidation.",closed_qa
Does magnetic resonance fluoroscopy allow targeted delivery of mesenchymal stem cells to infarct borders in Swine?,"The local environment of delivered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may affect their ultimate phenotype. MR fluoroscopy has the potential to guide intramyocardial MSC injection to desirable targets, such as the border between infarcted and normal tissue. We tested the ability to (1) identify infarcts, (2) navigate injection catheters to preselected targets, (3) inject safely even into fresh infarcts, and (4) confirm injection success immediately. A 1.5-T MRI scanner was customized for interventional use, with rapid imaging, independent color highlighting of catheter channels, multiple-slice 3D rendering, catheter-only viewing mode, and infarct-enhanced imaging. MRI receiver coils were incorporated into guiding catheters and injection needles. These devices were tested for heating and used for targeted MSC delivery. In infarcted pigs, myocardium was targeted by MR fluoroscopy. Infarct-enhanced imaging included both saturation preparation MRI after intravenous gadolinium and wall motion. Porcine MSCs were MRI-labeled with iron-fluorescent particles. Catheter navigation and multiple cell injections were performed entirely with MR fluoroscopy at 8 frames/s with 1.7x3.3x8-mm voxels. Infarct-enhanced MR fluoroscopy permitted excellent delineation of infarct borders. All injections were safely and successfully delivered to their preselected targets, including infarct borders. Iron-fluorescent particle-labeled MSCs were readily visible on delivery in vivo and post mortem.","Precise targeted delivery of potentially regenerative cellular treatments to recent myocardial infarction borders is feasible with an MR catheter delivery system. MR fluoroscopy permits visualization of catheter navigation, myocardial function, infarct borders, and labeled cells after injection.",closed_qa
Are responses to altered oxygen tension distinct between human stem cells of high and low chondrogenic capacity?,"Lowering oxygen from atmospheric level (hyperoxia) to the physiological level (physioxia) of articular cartilage promotes mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) chondrogenesis. However, the literature is equivocal regarding the benefits of physioxic culture on preventing hypertrophy of MSC-derived chondrocytes. Articular cartilage progenitors (ACPs) undergo chondrogenic differentiation with reduced hypertrophy marker expression in hyperoxia but have not been studied in physioxia. This study sought to delineate the effects of physioxic culture on both cell types undergoing chondrogenesis. MSCs were isolated from human bone marrow aspirates and ACP clones were isolated from healthy human cartilage. Cells were differentiated in pellet culture in physioxia (2 % oxygen) or hyperoxia (20 % oxygen) over 14 days. Chondrogenesis was characterized by biochemical assays and gene and protein expression analysis. MSC preparations and ACP clones of high intrinsic chondrogenicity (termed high-GAG) produced abundant matrix in hyperoxia and physioxia. Poorly chondrogenic cells (low-GAG) demonstrated a significant fold-change matrix increase in physioxia. Both high-GAG and low-GAG groups of MSCs and ACPs significantly upregulated chondrogenic genes; however, only high-GAG groups had a concomitant decrease in hypertrophy-related genes. High-GAG MSCs upregulated many common hypoxia-responsive genes in physioxia while low-GAG cells downregulated most of these genes. In physioxia, high-GAG MSCs and ACPs produced comparable type II collagen but less type I collagen than those in hyperoxia. Type X collagen was detectable in some ACP pellets in hyperoxia but reduced or absent in physioxia. In contrast, type X collagen was detectable in all MSC preparations in hyperoxia and physioxia.","MSC preparations and ACP clones had a wide range of chondrogenicity between donors. Physioxia significantly enhanced the chondrogenic potential of both ACPs and MSCs compared with hyperoxia, but the magnitude of response was inversely related to intrinsic chondrogenic potential. Discrepancies in the literature regarding MSC hypertrophy in physioxia can be explained by the use of low numbers of preparations of variable chondrogenicity. Physioxic differentiation of MSC preparations of high chondrogenicity significantly decreased hypertrophy-related genes but still produced type X collagen protein. Highly chondrogenic ACP clones had significantly lower hypertrophic gene levels, and there was little to no type X collagen protein in physioxia, emphasizing the potential advantage of these cells.",closed_qa
Does large-scale profiling of signalling pathways reveal an asthma specific signature in bronchial smooth muscle cells?,"Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) cells from asthmatic patients maintain in vitro a distinct hyper-reactive (""primed"") phenotype, characterized by increased release of pro-inflammatory factors and mediators, as well as hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy. This ""primed"" phenotype helps to understand pathogenesis of asthma, as changes in BSM function are essential for manifestation of allergic and inflammatory responses and airway wall remodelling. To identify signalling pathways in cultured primary BSMs of asthma patients and non-asthmatic subjects by genome wide profiling of differentially expressed mRNAs and activated intracellular signalling pathways (ISPs). Transcriptome profiling by cap-analysis-of-gene-expression (CAGE), which permits selection of preferentially capped mRNAs most likely to be translated into proteins, was performed in human BSM cells from asthmatic (n=8) and non-asthmatic (n=6) subjects and OncoFinder tool were then exploited for identification of ISP deregulations. CAGE revealed >600 RNAs differentially expressed in asthma vs control cells (p≤0.005), with asthma samples showing a high degree of similarity among them. Comprehensive ISP activation analysis revealed that among 269 pathways analysed, 145 (p<0.05) or 103 (p<0.01) are differentially active in asthma, with profiles that clearly characterize BSM cells of asthmatic individuals. Notably, we identified 7 clusters of coherently acting pathways functionally related to the disease, with ISPs down-regulated in asthma mostly targeting cell death-promoting pathways and up-regulated ones affecting cell growth and proliferation, inflammatory response, control of smooth muscle contraction and hypoxia-related signalization.",These first-time results can now be exploited toward development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting ISP signatures linked to asthma pathophysiology.,closed_qa
Does dissecting childhood asthma with nasal transcriptomics distinguish subphenotypes of disease?,"Bronchial airway expression profiling has identified inflammatory subphenotypes of asthma, but the invasiveness of this technique has limited its application to childhood asthma. We sought to determine whether the nasal transcriptome can proxy expression changes in the lung airway transcriptome in asthmatic patients. We also sought to determine whether the nasal transcriptome can distinguish subphenotypes of asthma. Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing was performed on nasal airway brushings from 10 control subjects and 10 asthmatic subjects, which were compared with established bronchial and small-airway transcriptomes. Targeted RNA sequencing nasal expression analysis was used to profile 105 genes in 50 asthmatic subjects and 50 control subjects for differential expression and clustering analyses. We found 90.2% overlap in expressed genes and strong correlation in gene expression (ρ = .87) between the nasal and bronchial transcriptomes. Previously observed asthmatic bronchial differential expression was strongly correlated with asthmatic nasal differential expression (ρ = 0.77, P = 5.6 × 10(-9)). Clustering analysis identified TH2-high and TH2-low subjects differentiated by expression of 70 genes, including IL13, IL5, periostin (POSTN), calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1), and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B (SERPINB2). TH2-high subjects were more likely to have atopy (odds ratio, 10.3; P = 3.5 × 10(-6)), atopic asthma (odds ratio, 32.6; P = 6.9 × 10(-7)), high blood eosinophil counts (odds ratio, 9.1; P = 2.6 × 10(-6)), and rhinitis (odds ratio, 8.3; P = 4.1 × 10(-6)) compared with TH2-low subjects. Nasal IL13 expression levels were 3.9-fold higher in asthmatic participants who experienced an asthma exacerbation in the past year (P = .01). Several differentially expressed nasal genes were specific to asthma and independent of atopic status.",Nasal airway gene expression profiles largely recapitulate expression profiles in the lung airways. Nasal expression profiling can be used to identify subjects with IL13-driven asthma and a TH2-skewed systemic immune response.,closed_qa
Do effects of gaze strategy on standing postural stability in older multifocal wearers?,"Postural instability in older people is associated with an increased risk of falling. This experiment investigated the effects of different gaze strategies on postural stability in older people, when using distance single-vision compared with multifocal (progressive addition lens and bifocal) spectacles. Eighteen healthy older habitual multifocal spectacle-wearers (mean age 72.1 +/- 4.0 years) participated in a randomised, cross-over study. Postural stability during quiet standing was assessed as the root mean square excursion in the centre of pressure (RMS-COP) in the antero-posterior direction. Ground reaction force data were collected (for 30 seconds), while subjects viewed one of two visual targets (one square metre) of different spatial frequencies and contrasts, while wearing either distance single-vision or multifocal (progressive addition and bifocal) spectacles. The visual targets were positioned either ahead at eye-level or on the ground (viewing distance 2.06 metres) and viewed under the following head-gaze conditions; 'head neutral-gaze forward', 'head flexed-gaze down' and 'head neutral-gaze down'. The type of spectacles worn or the target viewed had no significant effect on postural stability but postural stability deteriorated (antero-posterior RMS-COP excursion increased) in the 'head neutral-gaze down' compared with the 'head flexed-gaze down' and 'head neutral-gaze forward' conditions (5.9, 5.5 and 5.0 mm respectively, p < 0.001).","Multifocal use had no effect on standing postural stability. Irrespective of spectacles worn, when fixating a visual target positioned at ground level, postural stability was better in the 'head flexed-gaze down' condition compared with the 'head neutral-gaze down' condition. A useful strategy to reduce falling in the older person might be to advise multifocal and distance single-vision spectacle-wearers to flex their heads rather than just lower their eyes when looking downwards.",closed_qa
Does vitamin E protect human skeletal muscle from damage during surgical ischemia-reperfusion?,"The biochemical and morphological alterations induced in lower limb skeletal muscle by ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) during aortic surgery and the effect of vitamin E pretreatment were investigated. Two groups of patients undergoing aortic aneurysm resection, one untreated and one treated with vitamin E, were examined. Quadricep muscle biopsies were taken after induction of anesthesia, at the end of ischemia, and after reperfusion. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content and morphology of biopsies were examined to assess peroxidative processes. Ischemia did not induce an increase in MDA content but did increase neutrophil infiltration in muscle fibers of untreated patients. Reperfusion led to a significant increase in MDA content and to intermyofibrillar edema and mitochondrial swelling. The MDA content was not increased during ischemia and neutrophil infiltration was minimal in vitamin E treated patients. At reperfusion, the MDA content, the ultrastructural injuries and neutrophil infiltration were significantly reduced by the treatment.",Vitamin E is effective in reducing the oxidative muscle damage occurring after a period of I-R.,closed_qa
Is cD123 immunohistochemistry for plasmacytoid dendritic cells useful in the diagnosis of scarring alopecia?,"Distinguishing types of lymphocytic scarring alopecia is often difficult because of the overlapping features. Recently, the presence of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) was demonstrated and further shown to help distinguish lupus from other dermatoses.1-6 This study aims to determine if the presence and distribution of PDCs can aid in the diagnosis of scarring alopecia. Cases of scarring alopecia due to chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE), lichen planopilaris (LPP) and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) were examined histopathologically. A total of 45 total biopsies were evaluated and CD123 immunohistochemistry was performed on all samples. The relative percentage of PDCs, the presence of clusters and the distribution of CD123+ cells were noted. PDCs comprised a greater percentage of the infiltrate and were arranged in clusters in cases of CCLE vs. LPP or CCCA. In CCLE, the location of PDCs was perivascular, perifollicular, perieccrine and/or at the follicular junction. In LPP and CCCA, PDCs were mainly arranged as single, interstitial cells.",Our findings suggest that the presence and arrangement of CD123+ PDCs may assist in the diagnosis of scarring alopecia. We anticipate this will be of value in diagnosing challenging cases of highly inflammatory scarring alopecia.,closed_qa
The chronic pain conundrum: should we CHANGE from relying on past history to assessing prognostic factors?,"Despite limited empirical support, chronic pain has traditionally been defined mainly on the basis of its duration, which takes no account of the causative mechanisms or its clinical significance.SCOPE: For this commentary on current pain management practice, the CHANGE PAIN Advisory Board considered the evidence for adopting a prognostic definition of chronic pain. The rationale underlying this approach is to take psychological and behavioural factors into account, as well as the multidimensional nature of pain. Measures of pain intensity, interference with everyday activities, role disability, depression, duration and number of pain sites are used to calculate a risk score, which indicates the likelihood of a patient having pain in the future. The consistency of a prognostic definition with the concept of integrated patient care was also considered. When this method was compared with the number of pain days experienced over the previous 6 months--in patients with back pain, headache or orofacial pain--it was a better predictor of clinically significant pain 6 months later for all three pain conditions. Further evidence supporting this approach is that several factors other than the duration of pain have been shown to be important prognostic indicators, including unemployment, functional disability, anxiety and self-rated health. The use of a multifactorial risk score may also suggest specific measures to improve outcomes, such as addressing emotional distress. These measures should be undertaken as part of an integrated pain management strategy; chronic pain is a biopsychosocial phenomenon and all aspects of the patient's pain must be dealt with appropriately and simultaneously for treatment to be effective.","The implementation of a prognostic definition and wider adoption of integrated care could bring significant advantages. However, these measures require improved training in pain management and structural revision of specialist facilities, for which political support is essential.",closed_qa
Should a doctor stop rendering medical services?,"According to the general idea a doctor can start the medical management process in an adult and not legally incapacitated patient after the patient has given consent to initiate such a process. The patient's refusal makes rendering medical services impossible, irrespective of their scope and kind. It should be emphasized that such a refusal is respected if it is expressed fully, clearly and consciously. Cases in which such a refusal is expressed by an intoxicated suicidal patient, remaining under the influence of narcotics, drugs or medicaments which characterize with a similar activity should be particularly analysed. Although such a person is able to verbally declare his objection, his ability to process the information given by the doctor before initiating medical procedures is limited, or even non-existant. The refusal therefore cannot be regarded as reliable, which results in rendering medical services to the patient. An analysis was made of Acts of Law and the opinions of the judiciar by comparing and excluding contradictory and incoherent elements. Despite the lack of clear regulations of a patient rejecting procedures aimed at saving the patient's life, or the prevention of serious health impairment or sustaining injury, it should be assumed that the objection expressed by the patient who does not demonstrate the ability to process the information provided by the doctor is not reliable, and the doctor is therefore still obliged to render medical services. External factors, such as consumption of alcohol, narcotics and drugs, which characterize with a similar activity impair perception and make the taking of a conscious decision impossible. Not providing medical help and introducing direct compulsion would mean neglecting provision of due diligence in the process of treatment and, as a consequence, placing the patient's health at risk, and suffering from negative implications for the patient's life and/or health in the future.","Current provisions should directly regulate the negligence of respecting a refusal expressed 'unconsciously' by a patient who remains under the influence of alcohol, narcotics, drugs or medicaments which characterize with a similar activity. Moreover, apart from legal provisions, the law providers should consider introducing a direct compulsion in patients who are unable to make a conscious decision in the treatment process.",closed_qa
Does an outcome-based approach to continuing medical education improve physicians' competences in rational prescribing?,"Continuing medical education (CME) is compulsory in Iran, and traditionally it is lecture-based, which is mostly not successful. Outcome-based education has been proposed for CME programs.AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of an outcome-based educational intervention with a new approach based on outcomes and aligned teaching methods, on knowledge and skills of general physicians (GPs) working in primary care compared with a concurrent CME program in the field of ""Rational prescribing"". The method used was cluster randomized controlled design. All GPs working in six cities in one province in Iran were invited to participate. The cities were matched and randomly divided into an intervention arm for education on rational prescribing with an outcome-based approach, and a control arm for a traditional program on the same topic. Knowledge and skills were assessed using a pre- and post-test, including case scenarios. In total, 112 GPs participated. There were significant improvements in knowledge and prescribing skills after the training in the intervention arm as well as in comparison with the changes in the control arm. The overall intervention effect was 26 percentage units.",The introduction of an outcome-based approach in CME appears to be effective when creating programs to improve GPs' knowledge and skills.,closed_qa
Does dextromethorphan inhibit ischemia-induced c-fos expression and delayed neuronal death in hippocampal neurons?,"Dextromethorphan (DM), a widely used antitussive agent, has been shown to possess both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties functionally related to its inhibitory effects on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. The current study was designed to determine whether DM administration prevents delayed neuronal degeneration in central nervous system areas after global forebrain ischemia and whether this correlates with inhibition of induction of the immediate early gene c-fos. Mongolian gerbils, anesthetized with 2% halothane in air at 37 degrees C, received either 0.9% sodium chloride (vehicle, n = 9) or 50 mg/kg DM in vehicle (n = 9) by intraperitoneal injection before bilateral carotid artery occlusion. After 1 h of reperfusion under anesthesia, the animals were killed and the brains removed. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect neurons expressing Fos protein. Computer-assisted image analysis quantified changes in the number of labeled neurons as a function of drug treatment. To determine the extent of delayed neuronal degeneration within the hippocampus, other animals were treated with either DM (n = 7) or vehicle (n = 6) before carotid artery occlusion and allowed to survive for 1 week. Global forebrain ischemia produced consistent patterns of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and neocortex of vehicle-treated animals. DM inhibited the induction of c-fos from 65% to 91%. DM also protected against delayed neuronal degeneration in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (P < 0.001).",The induction of nuclear-associated Fos protein represents a sensitive marker of cellular responses to ischemia and a method to assay the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions. DM markedly inhibited ischemia-induced Fos expression and prevented cell death in CA1. DM given before conditions of ischemia or decreased central nervous system perfusion may be highly beneficial.,closed_qa
Do ovarian carcinoma cells influence differentiation of Lin-CD45RA- dendritic cell precursors into two mature subtypes in vitro?,"Decreased number and impaired function of dendritic cells (DCs) have been found in ovarian carcinoma microenvironment. The study was designed to detect if this phenomenon was associated with abnormal DC differentiation influenced by ovarian carcinoma cells. FLT-3L and SCF were used for expanding DC precursors from CD34+ progenitors. GM-CSF and TNF-alpha were used to induce mature DCs. Supernatants of cultured ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 were added, in order to study their influence on the differentiation and maturation of Lin-CD45RA- DC precursors. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell subtypes and molecular surface markers. Allogeneic T-cell proliferation assay was used to exam stimulatory activity of DCs. IL-12 secretion was tested by ELISA. Lin-CD45RA- DC precursors cultured with GM-CSF and TNF-alpha generated HLA-DR+CD11C+CD123- myeloid DCs (mDCs) and HLA-DR+CD11C-CD123+ plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in vitro. The supernatants from ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 (SKOV3-supernatants) increased pDCs and decreased mDCs compared with pure medium or supernatants of normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells. There were no significantly different expressions of HLA-DR and CD80 by DCs between with and without SKOV3-supernatants. But DCs treated with SKOV3-supernatants were shown to have impaired immune activity to stimulate proliferation of allogeneic CD3+ T cells and secrete IL-12.","Ovarian carcinoma cells influence differentiation of Lin-CD45RA- DC precursors into subtypes of mature DCs in vitro. This resulted in fewer mDCs, increased number of pDCs, and impairment of mature DCs immune activity.",closed_qa
Normal postural responses preceding shoulder flexion: co-activation or asymmetric activation of transverse abdominis?,"It is suggested that activation of the transverse abdominis muscle has a stabilizing effect on the lumbar spine by raising intra-abdominal pressure without added disc compression. However, its feedforward activity has remained a controversial issue. In addition, research regarding bilateral activation of trunk muscles during a unilateral arm movement is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate bilateral anticipatory activity of trunk muscles during unilateral arm flexion. Eighteen healthy subjects (aged 25 ± 3.96 years) participated in this study and performed 10 trials of rapid arm flexion in response to a visual stimulus. The electromyographic activity of the right anterior deltoid (AD) and bilateral trunk muscles including the transverse abdominis/internal oblique (TA/IO), superficial lumbar multifidus (SLM) and lumbar erector spine (LES) was recorded. The onset latency and anticipatory activity of the recorded trunk muscles were calculated. The first muscle activated in anticipation of the right arm flexion was the left TA/IO. The right TA/IO activated significantly later than all other trunk muscles (P<0.0005). In addition, anticipatory activity of the right TA/IO was significantly lower than all other trunk muscles (P<0.0005). There was no significant difference in either onset latency or anticipatory activity among other trunk muscles (P>0.05).",Healthy subjects showed no bilateral anticipatory co-activation of TA/IO in unilateral arm elevation. Further investigations are required to delineate normal muscle activation pattern in healthy subjects prior to prescribing bilateral activation training of transverse abdominis for subjects with chronic low back pain.,closed_qa
Is a polymorphism in TLR2 associated with arterial thrombosis in a multiethnic population of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?,"Thrombosis is a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Studies that have investigated the genetics of thrombosis in SLE are limited. We undertook this study to assess the association of previously implicated candidate genes, particularly Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, with pathogenesis of thrombosis. We genotyped 3,587 SLE patients from 3 multiethnic populations for 77 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genes, primarily in TLRs 2, 4, 7, and 9, and we also genotyped 64 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs). We first analyzed association with arterial and venous thrombosis in the combined population via logistic regression, adjusting for top principal components of the AIMs and other covariates. We also subjected an associated SNP, rs893629, to meta-analysis (after stratification by ethnicity and study population) to confirm the association and to test for study population or ethnicity effects. In the combined analysis, the SNP rs893629 in the KIAA0922/TLR2 region was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis (logistic P = 6.4 × 10(-5) , false discovery rate P = 0.0044). Two additional SNPs in TLR2 were also suggestive: rs1816702 (logistic P = 0.002) and rs4235232 (logistic P = 0.009). In the meta-analysis by study population, the odds ratio (OR) for arterial thrombosis with rs893629 was 2.44 (95% confidence interval 1.58-3.76), without evidence for heterogeneity (P = 0.78). By ethnicity, the effect was most significant among African Americans (OR 2.42, P = 3.5 × 10(-4) ) and European Americans (OR 3.47, P = 0.024).","TLR2 gene variation is associated with thrombosis in SLE, particularly among African Americans and European Americans.

Does ileostomy formation prolong hospital length of stay after open anterior resection when performed within an enhanced recovery programme?,"Previous studies have implicated stoma formation as an independent factor prolonging length of stay (LOS) after colorectal surgery. We examined whether loop ileostomy (LI) formation during an open anterior resection affected LOS within a newly developed enhanced recovery programme (ERP). This involved reorganization of services, including stoma care, to optimize pre- and perioperative patient education, training and expectation, while applying the standard scientific principles of enhanced recovery. Data were collected prospectively on 72 consecutive open anterior resections (33 with LI) to see whether LI affected LOS. Stomas were fashioned at the surgeon's discretion and patients were discharged according to agreed criteria. Thirty-three of the 72 patients had a covering LI performed. The overall age range was 32-85 years (median 68), with 40 patients being men. LOS for all 72 patients ranged from 3 to 34 days. The median and mean LOS were the same for both groups (median 6 days, mean 8 days). The complication rate was 44% (32/72) with a leak rate of 7% (5/72) and a mortality of 1.4% (1/72). Between the two groups (no ileostomy vs ileostomy), there was no statistically significant difference in complications (41%vs 48%), leakage (8%vs 6%) and readmission rates (12%vs 5%).",A covering loop ileostomy need not prolong hospital stay after open anterior resection.,closed_qa
Are disturbances of gastric electrical control activity after laparotomic cholecystectomy related to interleukin-6 concentrations?,"The aim of the present study was to characterize the disturbances of gastric electrical control activity after cholecystectomy and to correlate electrogastrographic (EGG) findings with inflammatory markers. 52 adult patients were examined in conjunction with planned laparotomic or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Gastric myoelectrical activity was recorded with a MicroDigitrapper device using three Ag-AgCl disposable skin electrodes. The dominant frequency was calculated using computerized algorithms. Repeated EGG records were correlated with inflammatory parameters - interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Both basal and stimulated gastric electrical frequency decreased significantly in the postoperative phase measured 6 h after the start of surgery (p < 0.01). Postoperative bradygastria (electrical control activity frequency <2.4 cpm) was relatively more expressed after open cholecystectomy. Among the patients with a laparotomic cholecystectomy, IL-6 maximal postoperative concentrations correlated positively with a prolonged restitution of normal gastric activity.",EGG examination showed a high sensitivity in the evaluation of gastric electrical activity after both laparotomic and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

"Are osteoprotegerin , inflammation and dyslipidemia associated with abdominal aortic calcification in non-diabetic patients on peritoneal dialysis?","Abdominal aortic calcification (AC) has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in hemodialysis patients but is rarely discussed in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We examined the independent predictors and predictive power for survival of AC in prevalent PD patients. AC was detected by computed tomography (CT) and represented as the percentage of the total aortic cross-section area affected by AC (%AC). The predictors of %AC ≥ 15 were examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the hazard ratios associated with high %AC. A total of 183 PD patients were recruited to receive CT scans and divided into group 1 (%AC < 15, n = 97), group 2 (%AC ≥ 15, n = 41), and group 3 (diabetic patients, n = 45). Group 1 patients had lower osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels than group 2 patients (798 ± 378 vs. 1308 ± 1350 pg/mL, p < 0.05). The independent predictors for %AC ≥ 15 included the atherogenic index, OPG, and C-reactive protein (CRP).

Do dietary long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent allergic sensitization to cow 's milk protein in mice?,"Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies in children and no treatment is available. Dietary lipid composition may affect the susceptibility to develop allergic disease. Assess whether dietary supplementation with long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) prevents the establishment of food allergy. Mice were fed a control or fish oil diet before and during oral sensitization with whey. Acute allergic skin response, serum immunoglobulins as well as dendritic cell (DC) and T cell subsets in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen and/or small intestine were assessed. The acute allergic skin response was reduced by more than 50% in sensitized mice fed the fish oil diet compared to the control diet. In addition, anti-whey-IgE and anti-whey-IgG1 levels were decreased in the fish oil group. Serum transfer confirmed that the Th2-type humoral response was suppressed since sera of fish oil fed sensitized mice had a diminished capacity to induce an allergic effector response in naïve recipient mice compared to control sera. Furthermore, the acute skin response was diminished upon passive sensitization in fish oil fed naïve recipient mice. In addition, the percentage of activated Th1 cells was reduced by fish oil in spleen and MLN of sham mice. The percentage of activated Th2 cells was reduced in both sham- and whey-sensitized mice. In contrast, whey-sensitized mice showed an increased percentage of CD11b+CD103+CD8α- DC in MLN in association with enhanced FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in spleen and intestine of fish oil fed whey-sensitized mice compared to sham mice.","Dietary n-3 LCPUFA largely prevented allergic sensitization in a murine model for cow's milk allergy by suppressing the humoral response, enhancing local intestinal and systemic Treg and reducing acute allergic symptoms, suggesting future applications for the primary prevention of food allergy.",closed_qa
Does bubble CPAP Support after Discontinuation of Mechanical Ventilation protect Rat Lungs with Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury?,"Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (BCPAP) has been used in neonates with respiratory distress for decades, but its lung-protective effect and underlying mechanism has not been investigated. To test the hypothesis that BCPAP use after extubation decreases lung injury and that alterations to lung nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 3 expression may be one of the underlying mechanisms. We compared gas exchange, lung injury severity, and lung NOS expression among rats with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) treated with either BCPAP or spontaneous breathing. After high tidal volume ventilation for 30 min, the rats were randomly divided to three groups: a control group underwent spontaneous breathing (n = 7), and two BCPAP groups were treated with the bubble technique with either a 2.5-mm-diameter (n = 7) or a 5.5-mm-diameter (n = 7) expiratory limb for 2 h. The bubble technique (2.5 and 5.5 mm diameter combined) resulted in a significantly higher PaO2, decreased alveolar protein levels (1.01 vs. 1.43 mg/kg, p < 0.05), a lower lung injury score (3.87 vs. 4.86, p < 0.05), and decreased NOS3 expression (1.99 vs. 3.32, p < 0.05) compared to spontaneous breathing in the control group. BCPAP with a 2.5-mm-diameter and with a 5.5-mm-diameter expiratory limb was not different with regard to gas exchange, alveolar protein levels, and lung injury scores, but there was a trend for lower NOS3 expression in the 5.5-mm group (1.41 vs. 2.56, p = 0.052).",BCPAP decreases lung injury in rats with VILI after stopping mechanical ventilation.

Is the combination of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL/Apo2L ) and Genistein effective in inhibiting pancreatic cancer growth?,"Our previous studies have shown that, contrary to many other human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, AsPC1 cells are resistant to the apoptotic effect of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, also called Apo2L (TRAIL/Apo2L). In our in vitro studies, the combination of TRAIL/Apo2L and protein synthesis inhibitor, genistein, but not genistein alone, was, however, effective in inducing apoptosis in AsPC1 cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of TRAIL/Apo2L with genistein on the growth of AsPC1 cells in vitro and in vivo. Mice with orthotopically transplanted AsPC1 cells were treated either with TRAIL/Apo2L, Genistein (Gen) or a combination of both (TRAIL/Apo2L + Gen) for 14 days. After 14 days, the size and weight of the tumors were registered and the apoptosis of the tumor cells were determined by the TUNEL method. In vitro, the effect of combination treatment on cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay and apoptosis was assessed by DAPI staining. FADD, caspase 3, and PARP proteins were determined by Western blot. No toxic side effects were observed in either group. The tumor volume was significantly smaller and the apoptotic ratio was higher in the TRAIL + Gen group than in the other 2 groups. The apoptotic effect was associated with the caspase-3 activation. Z-VAD-FMK partially inhibited apoptosis by TRAIL + Gen.","These results indicate that the combination of TRAIL/Apo2L with genistein presents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Are abductor tendon tears associated with hypertrophy of the tensor fasciae latae muscle?,"To evaluate the association between hypertrophy of the tensor fasciae latae muscle and abductor tendon tears. Thirty-five patients who underwent MRI of the abductor tendons of the hip were included in this retrospective study. A subgroup of 18 patients was examined bilaterally. The area of the tensor fasciae latae muscle and the area of the sartorius muscle (size reference) were quantified at the level of the femoral head, and a ratio was calculated. Two radiologists assessed the integrity of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon in consensus. Data were analyzed with a Mann-Whitney U test. Sixteen out of 35 patients (46 %) had a tear of the gluteus medius or minimus tendon. The ratio of the area of the tensor fasciae latae to the sartorius muscle was significantly higher (p = .028) in the group with an abductor tendon tear (median 2.25; Interquartile Range [IQR] = 1.97-3.21) compared to the group without any tears (median 1.91; IQR = 1.52-2.26). The bilateral subanalysis showed that in patients without a tear, the ratio of the two areas did not differ between each side (p = .966), with a median of 1.54 (primary side) and 1.76 (contralateral side). In patients with an abductor tendon tear the ratio was significantly higher (p = .031) on the side with a tear (median 2.81) compared to the contralateral healthy side (1.67).",Patients with abductor tendon tears showed hypertrophy of the tensor fasciae latae muscle when compared to the contralateral healthy side and to patients without a tear.,closed_qa
Does insulin resistance syndrome predict coronary heart disease events in elderly type 2 diabetic men?,"To investigate whether cardiovascular risk factors cluster with hyperinsulinemia in elderly type 2 diabetic subjects and, if so, whether this clustering predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) events during a 7-year follow-up. Clustering of cardiovascular risk factors was analyzed by factor analysis. Cox regression models were used to investigate whether these clusters (factors) predict CHD events (CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) during a 7-year follow-up in 229 type 2 diabetic subjects aged 65-74 years. There were 70 CHD events (21 in men and 49 in women) during the follow-up period. In diabetic men, components of the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) loaded on Factor 1 (the insulin resistance factor), which reflected high fasting insulin, obesity (high BMI), central obesity (high waist-to-hip ratio), high total triglycerides, and a short duration of diabetes. Only this IRS factor predicted CHD events in multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.08-2.71, P = 0.022). In diabetic women, components of IRS loaded on two factors, none of which predicted CHD events. In women, only Factor 4, characterized by advanced age, left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram, high alcohol consumption, high systolic blood pressure, and albuminuria, predicted CHD events in multivariate Cox regression analysis (1.34, 1.03-1.74, P = 0.03).",IRS is a risk factor for CHD in elderly type 2 diabetic men.,closed_qa
Do peripheral muscarinic receptors mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of auricular acupuncture?,"The cholinergic and opioid systems play important roles in modulating inflammation. This study tests whether auricular acupuncture (AA) produces anti-inflammatory effects via opioid and peripheral cholinergic receptors in a rat model. Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and inflammation was induced by intraplantar injection of carrageenan. Electroacupuncture was performed at auricular points bilaterally. The severity of inflammation was assessed using changes in paw volume and thermal and mechanical pain thresholds of the rats during recovery from anesthesia. Electroacupuncture at selected auricular acupoints significantly reduced paw edema and mechanical hyperalgesia, with no significant effect on thermal hyperalgesia. The anti-edematous and analgesic effects of AA were abolished by blockade of peripheral cholinergic muscarinic receptors with methyl atropine. Blockade of local muscarinic receptors at the inflamed site with a small dose of atropine also antagonized the anti-edematous effect of AA. By contrast, systemic opioid receptor blockade with naloxone did not antagonize the anti-inflammatory effects of AA.",This study discovers a role of peripheral muscarinic receptors in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of AA. The cholinergic muscarinic mechanism appears to be more important than the opioid mechanism in the anti-inflammatory action of AA.,closed_qa
Does histologic type predict survival in patients with retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma?,"Histologic grade, completeness of resection, and presence of metastases are traditionally regarded as the primary factors in predicting survival for retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RPSTS). We sought to examine the importance of histologic type as a prognostic factor among patients with RPSTS. We identified 2337 cases of RPSTS in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1988 to 2004. After excluding 273 cases of age <18, identification by autopsy only, or absence of histologic confirmation, we arrived at a final study cohort of 2064 patients. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for age, gender, race, histologic type, histologic grade, tumor size, extent of resection, and SEER summary stage. Among 33 histologic types, leiomyosarcoma (28.7%), well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (20.3%), liposarcoma not otherwise specified (NOS) (11.9%), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH-11.0%), and sarcoma NOS (10.7%) were the most prevalent. Grade distribution was low, 24.2%; intermediate, 16%; high 34.3%, and unknown, 25.5%. Surgery was performed in 85.8%, and radiotherapy was administered to 22.8%. With a median follow-up of 38 mo, median OS was 78, 35, 25, 18, and 10 mo for liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, other histologies, MFH, and sarcoma NOS, respectively (P < 0.0001). Median DSS was 120, 53, not reached, 30, and 13 mo for liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, other histologies, MFH, and sarcoma NOS, respectively (P < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, histologic type was associated with statistically significant differences in both OS and DSS.",Histologic type is an important predictor of survival in RPSTS.,closed_qa
Are aTP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) and subfamily C member 10 ( ABCC10 ) primary resistance factors for cabazitaxel?,"ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and subfamily C member 10 (ABCC10) proteins are efflux transporters that couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to the translocation of toxic substances and chemotherapeutic drugs out of cells. Cabazitaxel is a novel taxane that differs from paclitaxel by its lower affinity for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We determined the effects of cabazitaxel, a novel tubulin-binding taxane, and paclitaxel on paclitaxel-resistant, ABCB1-overexpressing KB-C2 and LLC-MDR1-WT cells and paclitaxel-resistant, ABCC10-overexpressing HEK293/ABCC10 cells by calculating the degree of drug resistance and measuring ATPase activity of the ABCB1 transporter. Decreased resistance to cabazitaxel compared with paclitaxel was observed in KB-C2, LLC-MDR1-WT, and HEK293/ABCC10 cells. Moreover, cabazitaxel had low efficacy, whereas paclitaxel had high efficacy in stimulating the ATPase activity of ABCB1, indicating a direct interaction of both drugs with the transporter.","ABCB1 and ABCC10 are not primary resistance factors for cabazitaxel compared with paclitaxel, suggesting that cabazitaxel may have a low affinity for these efflux transporters.",closed_qa
Are circulating immunoglobulins associated with intraplaque mast cell number and other vulnerable plaque characteristics in patients with carotid artery stenosis?,"Recently, we have shown that intraplaque mast cell numbers are associated with atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and with future cardiovascular events, which renders inhibition of mast cell activation of interest for future therapeutic interventions. However, the endogenous triggers that activate mast cells during the progression and destabilization of atherosclerotic lesions remain unidentified. Mast cells can be activated by immunoglobulins and in the present study, we aimed to establish whether specific immunoglobulins in plasma of patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy were related to (activated) intraplaque mast cell numbers and plasma tryptase levels. In addition, the levels were related to other vulnerable plaque characteristics and baseline clinical data. OxLDL-IgG, total IgG and total IgE levels were measured in 135 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy. No associations were observed between the tested plasma immunoglobulin levels and total mast cell numbers in atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, no associations were found between IgG levels and the following plaque characteristics: lipid core size, degree of calcification, number of macrophages or smooth muscle cells, amount of collagen and number of microvessels. Interestingly, statin use was negatively associated with plasma IgE and oxLDL-IgG levels.","In patients suffering from carotid artery disease, total IgE, total IgG and oxLDL-IgG levels do not associate with plaque mast cell numbers or other vulnerable plaque histopathological characteristics. This study thus does not provide evidence that the immunoglobulins tested in our cohort play a role in intraplaque mast cell activation or grade of atherosclerosis.",closed_qa
Does beta-glucan from two sources of oat concentrate affect postprandial glycemia in relation to the level of viscosity?,"Soluble dietary fiber has been shown to attenuate the postprandial rise in blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This effect seems to be related to its rheological properties including viscosity. We examined the intra-fiber variability between two different processing methods of concentrating beta-glucan from oats (aqueous vs. enzymatic) in relation to the level of viscosity of beta-glucan and its effect on postprandial glycemia in healthy individuals. In an acute, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 11 healthy subjects (gender: 5M:6F; age: 34 +/- 5 years; BMI: 23 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned, on three separate occasions, to consume one of three fiber-matched treatments along with a 75 g oral glucose drink. The enzymatically processed beta-glucan (Oat-A) differed from beta-glucan processed through the aqueous method (Oat-B) solely with regard to viscosity. Finger-prick capillary blood samples were obtained at fasting and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of the test drink. The viscosities of the fiber drinks were determined (Paar Physica UDS200 viscometer). Rheological measurements demonstrated that Oat-A had a significantly higher viscosity than Oat-B and control at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min (p < 0.001). The incremental area under the glucose curve (AUC) on Oat-A was 19.6% and 17% lower than that of Oat-B and control, respectively (p < 0.01).","This study shows that processing oat beta-glucan through enzymatic, rather than by aqueous methods, preserves the viscosity and improves postprandial glycemic control.",closed_qa
Are higher plasma IGF-1 levels associated with increased delta sleep in healthy older men?,"Sleep quality declines with age, with less time in deep or slow wave sleep (SWS) and reduced amplitude of the delta waves that characterize it. Age-related declines also occur in lean body mass, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). These changes in sleep quality and anabolic status may be related, as administration of GH or growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) can enhance SWS and decrease awakenings in young men. Here we examine the relationship between plasma IGF levels and delta sleep quality in older men. The sleep EEG of 30 healthy elderly men (64 +/- 6 yrs; range 50-75) was recorded on the second of 2 consecutive nights. Plasma samples were drawn within 3 weeks of EEG recording, and IGF levels were assayed by RIA after acid extraction. IGF explained 28% (semi-partial correlation coefficient r = .53; p = .003) of the variance in average delta energy per epoch of SWS, after age-related variance was removed. Higher IGF was associated with higher average delta energy. Similar results were obtained for total delta energy during SWS (r = .37, p = .04) 4nd time spent in SWS (r = .42, p = .02). Other measures of sleep quality (e.g., wakefulness, REM sleep) were not correlated with IGF. The IGF delta relationship was minimally influenced by moderator variables such as thyroxine (T3, T4), and/or body mass index (BMI).",We conclude that age-adjusted IGF levels in healthy senior men co-vary significantly with SWS and the delta energy that characterizes it.,closed_qa
Ultrasonographic elastography of thyroid nodules: is adding strain ratio to colour mapping better?,"The study was approved by the institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained. One hundred and thirty-one patients with 142 thyroid nodules>0.5 cm were prospectively enrolled between July 2010 and January 2011. Seven radiologists performed US elastography (iU22 Vision 2010; Philips, Seattle, WA, USA) using colour mapping and strain ratio for thyroid nodules blinded to the cytopathological results. Diagnostic performances of colour mapping alone, strain ratio alone, colour mapping and strain ratio, and colour mapping or strain ratio were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the 142 nodules, 69 (48.6%) were benign and 73 (51.4%) were malignant. Colour mapping of elastography showed a more frequent blue colour in malignant nodules than in benign nodules (65.8% versus 24.6%, p<0.0001). A higher ratio than 1.21 as the best cut-off value was found in 65.8% of malignant nodules and 46.4% of benign nodules (p = 0.030). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) of colour mapping alone was significantly greater than that of colour mapping or strain ratio (AUC = 0.706 versus AUC = 0.63, p = 0.0195) and similar to that of colour mapping and strain ratio (AUC = 0.673, p = 0.1364).","US elastography is helpful to predict malignant thyroid nodules. However, adding strain ratio to colour mapping does not improve performance compared to colour mapping alone.",closed_qa
Do early pregnancy serum neopterin concentrations predict spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic pregnant women?,"To investigate if early pregnancy serum neopterin concentrations (EPSN) could predict spontaneous preterm birth (SPB). EPSN was measured in 92 sera collected from 46 pregnant women with birth at term and 40 sera from 20 pregnant women with preterm birth. Two sera were collected for each case: in the first and early second trimester. EPSN concentrations correlate with gestational age (ρ=0.275, P=0.001), a correlation which was present in both groups: term and preterm birth. EPSN were higher in pregnancies with SPB compared with normal pregnancies (6.27±1.03 vs. 6.04±0.15, P=0.039). Patients with SPB showed a considerable increase of EPSN in the second trimester compared with patients with birth at term (7.30±1.53 vs. 6.16±0.23, P=0.043). A sharper increase was found in the group with SPB before 32 weeks of pregnancy (wp) (9.83±4.36 vs. 6.16±0.23, P=0.016). Pregnant women with an early second trimester serum neopterin value of above 8 nmol/L are associated with a risk of SPB before 32 wp (odds ratio=14.4, P=0.01) and of SPB before 34 wp (odds ratio=3.6, P=0.05), respectively.",EPSN increases with the gestational age and predicts SPB in asymptomatic pregnant women.,closed_qa
Does spleen artery embolization aggravate endotoxin hyporesponse of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with spleen injury?,": Spleen artery embolization (SAE) increases the success of nonoperative management of spleen injury; however, the immune alternation after SAE is unclear. This study searched the endotoxin responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in injured patients who received SAE. : Patients were subsequently enrolled when their spleen injuries were confirmed by computed tomographic scan. Peripheral blood samples were obtained within first, at third, fifth, and seventh postinjury days. PBMCs were isolated; nuclear factor (NF)-kB translocations, phosphorylated I-kB expressions, and in vitro tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels were assayed after endotoxin stimulation (ES). : Sixteen patients who received nonoperative managements were enrolled. Five patients received SAE (embolized patients) and 11 patients did not (nonembolized patients). Compared with those in controls, NF-kB translocations, phosphorylated I-kB expressions, and TNF-alpha levels after ES decreased significantly early in injured patients. NF-kB translocation and TNF-alpha levels after ES were indifferent at seventh day between nonembolized patients and controls, whereas significantly lower NF-kB p65 translocation and TNF-alpha levels after ES were found at seventh postinjury day in embolized patients than in controls. Compared with nonembolized patients, embolized patients had significantly lower levels of NF-kBp50 translocations after ES from first to third postinjury days and lower levels of NF-kB p65 translocations, TNF-alpha, and phosphorylated I-kB expressions after ES from first to fifth postinjury days.",: SAE dysregulates the NF-kB system and aggravates the cytokine hyporesponse upon ES of PBMCs in patients with spleen injury. These results implicate that SAE alters immune response and may increase susceptibility to infections in injured patients.,closed_qa
Is cleavage of the moaX-encoded fused molybdopterin synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis necessary for activity?,"Molybdopterin cofactor (MoCo) biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is associated with a multiplicity of genes encoding several enzymes in the pathway, including the molybdopterin (MPT) synthase, a hetero tetramer comprising two MoaD and two MoaE subunits. In addition to moaD1, moaD2, moaE1, moaE2, the M. tuberculosis genome also contains a moaX gene which encodes an MPT-synthase in which the MoaD and MoaE domains are located on a single polypeptide. In this study, we assessed the requirement for post-translational cleavage of MoaX for functionality of this novel, fused MPT synthase and attempted to establish a functional hierarchy for the various MPT-synthase encoding genes in M. tuberculosis. Using a heterologous Mycobacterium smegmatis host and the activity of the MoCo-dependent nitrate reductase, we confirmed that moaD2 and moaE2 from M. tuberculosis together encode a functional MPT synthase. In contrast, moaD1 displayed no functionality in this system, even in the presence of the MoeBR sulphurtransferase, which contains the rhodansese-like domain, predicted to activate MoaD subunits. We demonstrated that cleavage of MoaX into its constituent MoaD and MoaE subunits was required for MPT synthase activity and confirmed that cleavage occurs between the Gly82 and Ser83 residues in MoaX. Further analysis of the Gly81-Gly82 motif confirmed that both of these residues are necessary for catalysis and that the Gly81 was required for recognition/cleavage of MoaX by an as yet unidentified protease. In addition, the MoaE component of MoaX was able to function in conjunction with M. smegmatis MoaD2 suggesting that cleavage of MoaX renders functionally interchangeable subunits. Expression of MoaX in E. coli revealed that incorrect post-translational processing is responsible for the lack of activity of MoaX in this heterologous host.","There is a degree of functional interchangeability between the MPT synthase subunits of M. tuberculosis. In the case of MoaX, post-translational cleavage at the Gly82 residue is required for function.",closed_qa
Does oS 36-08 A2A RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ACTIVATION OF REGULATORY T CELLS attenuate HYPERTENSION-INDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR INJURY?,"Inflammatory processes plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of hypertension. Previous study have indicated that A2A receptor is closely related with immunogenic anti-inflammation process. The present study aimed to elucidate whether the activation of A2A receptor is involved in the regulation of hypertension-induced cardiovascular consequence via regulating immunoresponse. Deoxycorticosterone acetat (DOCA)-salt hypertensive mice were injected intraperitoneally with specific A2A receptor agonist (CGS21680) or antagonist (istradefylline) or PBS respectively. Fourteen days after DOCA-salt infusion, the expressional diversity of immune-related cytokines and chemokines were detected by quantitative real time PCR and western blot. Flow cytometric analysis was used to assess spleen CD4+, CD8+ and Foxp3+ T cells. The cardiovascular function of DOCA-salt mice was detected by wire myography and echocardiography. The treatment of CGS21680 resulted in a dramatically increase of regulatory T cells (Tregs,CD4+Foxp3+) in spleen, accompanied by the increased volume and weight of spleen (Figure), while istradefylline accelerated DOCA-salt induced hypertension inflammation. CGS21680 stimulation also resulted in decreased inflammatory cytokins level as IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP1 in heart. Relax function of aorta significantly elevated in CGS21680-treated DOCA-salt mice and the echocardiographic results display an obvious improvement of cardiovascular functions.","These data indicates that CGS21680 acts through A2A receptor to increase regulatory T cells, causing the attenuation of hypertension-induced cardiovascular injury. Overall, A2A receptor may be a novel role in hypertension therapeutic strategy.(Figure is included in full-text article.).",closed_qa
Do the pro-/anti-inflammatory effects of different fatty acids on visceral adipocytes are partially mediated by GPR120?,"This study examines whether G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) is involved in the pro-/anti-inflammatory effects of different types of fatty acids (FAs) in human visceral adipocytes, and whether these effects may be altered in obesity, a state with a chronic inflammation. Pro-/anti-inflammatory effects of palmitic, oleic, linoleic and docosahexaenoic acids on human visceral adipocytes were tested in mature adipocytes from non-obese and morbidly obese (MO) subjects. Also, the effects of these FAs were tested when the GPR120 gene was silenced. In adipocytes from non-obese subjects, palmitic and linoleic acids increased TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression (p < 0.05), and decreased IL-10 and adiponectin expression (p < 0.05). However, oleic and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) produced the opposite effect (p < 0.05). In adipocytes from MO subjects, all FAs used increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression (p < 0.05). Palmitic and linoleic acids decreased IL-10 and adiponectin expression (p < 0.05), but oleic acid and DHA did not have significant effects. Only oleic acid increased adiponectin expression (p < 0.05). The effects of FAs on TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and adiponectin expression in non-obese and MO subjects were significantly annulled when the GPR120 gene was silenced in visceral adipocytes differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells.","FAs are capable of directly acting on visceral adipocytes to modulate differently TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and adiponectin expression, with a different and greater effect in MO subjects. These effects are largely annulled when GPR120 expression was silenced, which suggests that they could be mediated by GPR120.",closed_qa
Is breastfeeding related to postpartum relapses in multiple sclerosis?,"To assess the relationship between breastfeeding and risk of puerperal relapses in a large cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We prospectively followed-up pregnancies occurring between 2002 and 2008 in women with MS, recruited from 21 Italian MS centers, and gathered data on breastfeeding through a standardized interview. The risk of relapses after delivery was assessed using the Cox regression analysis. A total of 302 out of 423 pregnancies in 298 women resulted in full-term deliveries. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year after delivery. The time-dependent profile of the relapse rate before, during, and after pregnancy did not differ between patients who breastfed and patients who did not. In the multivariate analysis, adjusting for age at onset, age at pregnancy, disease duration, disability level, and relapses in the year prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy, treatment with disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), and exposure to toxics, the only significant predictors of postpartum relapses were relapses in the year before pregnancy (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.5; 95%confidence interval [CI] 1.3-1.9; p < 0.001) and during pregnancy (HR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.5-3.3; p < 0.001).","In our sample, postpartum relapses were predicted only by relapses before and during pregnancy. Therefore, the reported association between breastfeeding and a lower risk of postpartum relapses may simply reflect different patient behavior, biased by the disease activity. Our results can assist neurologists facing the breastfeeding issue in mother counseling and shared decision-making. Especially, among patients with high risk of postpartum relapses, breastfeeding may not be feasible and early postpartum treatment should be an option.",closed_qa
Is high perceived stress linked to afternoon cortisol levels and greater symptom distress in patients with localized prostate cancer?,"Patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer can experience stress and symptoms that impact quality of life. The objectives of this study were to describe cortisol levels, perceived stress, symptoms, and symptom distress; compare differences in variables measured between RP and RT; and identify associations among cortisol levels, perceived stress, symptoms, and symptom distress in patients treated for localized prostate cancer. A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with 53 patients (RP n = 24, RT n = 29). Data from saliva, questionnaires, and interviews were collected within 3 months of treatment. Saliva samples were collected at 4 times over 2 consecutive days. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, and regressions. A robust diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion with heightened levels in the early morning and lowered levels late in the day was found. On average, the entire sample had moderate symptoms and symptom distress for urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. The RP group reported significantly more urinary and sexual dysfunction symptoms and fewer bowel symptoms than did the RT group. Perceived stress was positively correlated with higher afternoon cortisol levels and greater symptom distress.",Moderate symptoms and symptom distress found in our sample indicate the need for interventions to address these outcomes in men treated for prostate cancer.

Does autocrine production of amphiregulin predict sensitivity to both gefitinib and cetuximab in EGFR wild-type cancers?,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, lead to significant tumor regressions in 10% to 15% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR activating mutations. However, 30% to 40% of NSCLC patients, majority of whom are EGFR wild-type, develop stable disease following EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. EGFR-directed antibodies (cetuximab) are effective treatments for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, which seldom contain EGFR mutations. The determinant(s) of efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies in EGFR wild-type cancers is not well defined. We examined the relationship of EGFR ligands, EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha,and amphiregulin and the efficacy of gefitinib and cetuximab in EGFR wild-type NSCLC (n=10) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=4) cell lines. We compared amphiregulin expression using immunohistochemistry in EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients (n=24) that developed either stable or progressive disease following erlotinib or gefitinib treatment. Cell lines which produced >or=20 pmol/L amphiregulin, as detected by an ELISA, were significantly more likely to be growth inhibited by both gefitinib and cetuximab than those that produced minimal or no amphiregulin. In these cell lines, both cetuximab and gefitinib led to cell cycle arrest at the G(1)-S boundary and was associated with preferential inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 but not Akt signaling. Amphiregulin expression was significantly higher in NSCLC patients that developed stable disease compared with those that developed disease progression following gefitinib or erlotinib treatment.",Amphiregulin expression may help select EGFR wild-type patients who are likely to develop stable disease from EGFR-targeted therapies.,closed_qa
Does long-Term Response to Cholinesterase Inhibitor Treatment be Related to Functional MRI Response in Alzheimer 's Disease?,"Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) enhances cholinergic activity and alleviates clinical symptoms. However, there is variation in the clinical response as well as system level changes revealed by functional MRI (fMRI) studies. We investigated 18 newly diagnosed mild AD patients with fMRI using a face recognition task after a single oral dose of rivastigmine, a single dose of placebo and 1-month treatment with rivastigmine. The clinical follow-up took place at 6 and 12 months. MMSE score difference between baseline and the follow-ups showed a positive correlation with fMRI activation difference between treatment and placebo in the right prefrontal cortex. A negative correlation was found for the left prefrontal cortex and the left fusiform gyrus. In addition, greater signal intensity in the right versus the left fusiform gyrus predicted a response to ChEI with increasing MMSE scores during the follow-up with 77.8% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity.","The increased fMRI activation by cholinergic stimulation in brain areas associated with the processing of the visual task reveals still functioning brain networks and a subsequent positive effect of ChEI on cognition. Thus, fMRI may be useful for identifying AD patients most likely to respond to treatment with ChEI.",closed_qa
Are cRB1 gene mutations associated with keratoconus in patients with leber congenital amaurosis?,"To present an association of mutations in the CRB1 gene with keratoconus in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Sixteen patients with genotyped LCA (having the CRB1, CRX, RetGC, RPE65, and AIPL1 mutations) were recruited from one ophthalmology practice and examined for the presence of keratoconus. Corneal topography, visual acuity, and slit lamp biomicroscopic examination were performed in all cases. The mean age of the patients was 34.5 years (range, 13-74). Visual acuities ranged from 20/40 to light perception. Corneal topography was successfully collected in 15 of the cases. Five of the 16 cases had slit lamp and/or topographic features consistent with keratoconus. One patient had a clinical picture that was keratoglobus-like. Of these six cases, four had a CRB1 mutation and two had a CRX mutation. Of the three subjects with the CRX mutation, one had keratoconus, one had the keratoglobus-like presentation, and one was normal. Our cohort represents 14 separate, unrelated families. Only one family comprised multiple members with LCA. These were three affected brothers, one with keratoconus, all with CRB1 mutations.","Although the results cannot exclude other gene mutations, they suggest that LCA patients with a CRB1 mutation may have a particular susceptibility to keratoconus.",closed_qa
Does growth inhibitory factors in bovine faeces impair detection of Salmonella Dublin by conventional culture procedure?,"To analyse the relative importance of different biological and technical factors on the analytical sensitivity of conventional culture methods for detection of Salmonella Dublin in cattle faeces. Faeces samples collected from six adult bovines from different salmonella-negative herds were split into subpools and spiked with three strains of S.

The two sets were pre-enriched with and without novobiocin, followed by combinations of culture media (three types) and selective media (two types). The sensitivity of each combination and sources of variation in detection were determined by a generalized linear mixed model using a split-plot design.","Biological factors, such as faecal origin and S. Dublin strain influenced the sensitivity more than technical factors. Overall, the modified semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV)-culture medium had the most reliable detection capability, whereas detection with selenite cystine broth and Mueller Kauffman tetrathionate broth combinations varied more in sensitivity and rarely reached the same level of detection as MSRV in this experiment.",closed_qa
Is trans-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid ( anti-18F-FACBC ) a feasible alternative to 11C-methyl-L-methionine and magnetic resonance imaging for monitoring treatment response in gliomas?,"Amino acid PET tracers are promising for visualizing gliomas and evaluating radiochemotherapeutic effects. We compared the glioma detection and early response assessment utility between trans-1-amino-3-fluoro-1-(14)C-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-(14)C-FACBC) and (3)H-methyl-l-methionine ((3)H-Met) by simultaneously analyzing their uptake by rat gliomas treated with and without temozolomide (TMZ) in vitro and in vivo. C6 rat gliomas were incubated with low-dose TMZ to induce chemoresistance. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay demonstrated a significantly greater surviving fraction in the TMZ-resistant subline (C6R) than in drug-naive cells (C6). The anti-(14)C-FACBC and (3)H-Met uptakes were quantified using a triple-label accumulation assay to examine the relationship between tracer uptake and proliferation ((3)H-thymidine (TdR) accumulation rate) in tumor cells. C6 and C6R cells were inoculated into the right and left basal ganglia, respectively, of rats. Efficacy of TMZ against the orthotopic gliomas was analyzed by MRI, Evans blue extravasation, anti-(14)C-FACBC and (3)H-Met autoradiography, and MIB-5 proliferation index. The (3)H-TdR accumulation rate and amino acid tracer (anti-(14)C-FACBC and (3)H-Met) uptake significantly decreased 48 and 72 h, respectively, after TMZ treatment in C6 but not C6R cells. Anti-(14)C-FACBC uptake correlated significantly with (3)H-Met uptake and the (3)H-TdR accumulation rate. In the intracerebral glioma model, anti-(14)C-FACBC and (3)H-Met autoradiography clearly delineated the tumor extent, which spread well beyond the high-T2-intensity and enhancing lesions visible on MRI and Evans blue extravasation. TMZ significantly decreased anti-(14)C-FACBC and (3)H-Met uptake and the MIB-5 index of C6 but not C6R tumors. TMZ inhibited tracer uptake and tumor proliferation before morphological changes on MRI.","Anti-(14)C-FACBC, like (3)H-Met, was more sensitive than post-contrast T1-weighted MRI for detecting tumor extent and early tumor response to TMZ treatment. Anti-(18)F-FACBC should be a sensitive and precise imaging biomarker for tumor extent visualization and response assessment in glioma patients.",closed_qa
Are mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of insulin in endometrial cancer phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt dependent?,"To determine serum insulin levels, expression and phosphorylation of InsR, IRS-1 and Akt in endometrial cancer (EC) tissues, and to explore the correlation between them. To investigate if insulin-induced mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects are PI3K-dependent in EC cells. Serum insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. We performed RT-PCR and western blotting to evaluate the expression and activation of key proteins of PI3K/Akt pathway in 63 EC tissues. The proliferation and apoptosis rates were determined with MTT, BrdU and annexin V/PI assays. Serum insulin levels and InsR, IRS-1 and Akt expression and phosphorylation were significantly elevated in patients with EC compared to those without EC. Additionally, levels of p-InsR, p-IRS-1, and p-Akt were significantly higher in patients with high-grade, advanced stage, deep myometrial invasion, and lymph-node metastasis. The expression and activation of InsR, IRS-1, and p-Akt were positively related with the levels of serum insulin. The insulin-induced mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects in EC cells were blocked when cells were pre-incubated with LY294002. Ishikawa 3-H-12 cells showed increased p-Akt levels after treatment with insulin at 10(-8)M for 15min. The insulin-induced Akt activation was inhibited by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner.","Insulin played an essential role in EC tumorigenesis. Activation of InsR, IRS-1, and Akt was associated with features of aggressive EC. Insulin was a mitogenic and anti-apoptotic agent for EC cells, and these effects were dependent on PI3K/Akt pathway. Decreasing insulin level and blocking the InsR-IRS-PI3K-Akt pathway could be viable preventive and therapeutic strategies for EC.",closed_qa
Does a comparison of azithromycin and tobramycin eye drop on epithelial wound healing and tolerance after penetrating keratoplasty?,"After keratoplasty, antibiotic eye drops are used to prevent ocular infection until the recipient corneal epithelium has healed. We compared the effects of azithromycin, a new macrolide, with the effect of the standard antibiotics, tobramycin, on the (i) prevention of infection, (ii) epithelial healing, and (iii) ocular tolerance after penetrating keratoplasty. In this prospective, single-center, randomized study, patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty received postoperative topical dexamethasone and either azithromycin (n=23; Azyter(®); one drop twice daily for 3 days) or tobramycin (n=23; Tobrex(®); 1 drop 4 times daily until complete re-epithelialization). Daily slit-lamp examination with fluorescein was performed, and photographs were taken to digitally assess the re-epithelialized surface area. Daily questionnaires assessed ocular comfort and pain. There were no cases of infection in either group. The re-epithelialized area of the corneal graft increased at a similar rate in each group, with no difference between the groups on any day. The mean±SD days until complete re-epithelialization did not differ between tobramycin (4.14±1.17) and azithromycin (4.13±1.82) (P=0.89). Superficial punctate keratitis scores were similar for tobramycin (1.39) and azithromycin (1.34). Pain and discomfort scores improved each day after surgery with no differences between the groups on any day.",Postkeratoplasty epithelial healing and ocular tolerance were not significantly different between the azithromycin- and tobramycin-treatment groups. Our results support the use of azithromycin as an alternative to tobramycin after corneal surgery such as keratoplasty.,closed_qa
"Is calcitonin gene-related peptide a survival factor , inhibiting apoptosis in neonatal rat gubernaculum in vitro?","Testicular descent is proposed to occur in 2 stages. During the second stage, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) released from the genitofemoral nerve (GFN) causes maximal mitosis in the gubernacular bulb. As normal development requires a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, this study explored the effect of CGRP on apoptosis in the rat gubernacular bulb. Gubernacula were collected from male Sprague-Dawley rats at birth (D0) or 2 days post birth (D2), and placed in organ culture for 24 hours with or without CGRP (0.001 mol/L). The D2 rats were pretreated with capsaicin (sensory nerve toxin) or flutamide (antiandrogen) or untreated. D0 rats were untreated (n = 64). Sections of the bulb were stained using the TUNEL method to identify apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was calculated as the percentage of positive cells per hundred cells. Normal Sprague-Dawley rat gubernacula showed reduced apoptosis when cultured with CGRP, in D0 (7.0% vs 4.8%, P < .05) and D2 (4.9% vs 2.3%, P < .001). Greater apoptosis occurred at D0 compared to D2, without CGRP added (7.0% vs 4.9%, P < .05) and with CGRP (4.8% vs 2.3%, P < .001). For D2 gubernacula, capsaicin treatment increased apoptosis compared to controls, without CGRP added (4.9% vs 7.3%, P < .05) and with CGRP (2.3% vs 6.7%, P < .001). There was no difference in apoptosis when cultured with or without CGRP (7.3% vs 6.7%, nonsignificant) after capsaicin treatment. Flutamide treatment increased apoptosis compared to controls, but only with CGRP (2.3% vs 7.3%, P < .001). There was no difference in apoptosis when cultured with or without CGRP (7.1% vs 7.3%, nonsignificant) after flutamide.","Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) acts as a survival factor in the rat gubernaculum, possibly to steer cells away from a defined apoptotic pathway. Greater apoptosis occurs earlier in development. However, in vivo CGRP released from the genitofemoral nerve may be required to prevent apoptosis, as shown by pretreatment with the sensory nerve toxin capsaicin. Androgen is also involved in the pathway controlling apoptosis, as androgen blockade with flutamide inhibited the action of CGRP.",closed_qa
The impact of cardiac surgery in native valve infective endocarditis: can euroSCORE guide patient selection?,"Decision making regarding surgical intervention in native valve endocarditis (NVE) is often complex and surgery is withheld in a number of patients either because medical treatment is considered the best treatment or because the risk of operation is considered too high. The objective of this study was to investigate the outcome of surgical treatment and to validate the ability of euroSCORE to predict operative mortality in NVE patients. Prospective cohort study including 323 consecutive NVE patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on treatment strategy and indication/contraindication for surgery. The additive and logistic euroSCORE was calculated and the observed and predicted mortality was compared. Cardiac surgery was associated with a good prognosis, in-hospital and after 12months, compared to conservative treatment. After adjustment for confounders surgery was associated with a survival benefit (hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27-0.76%; p=0.003). When propensity score was used in regression adjustment, cardiac surgery was still associated with a better outcome after 12months (HR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25-0.68; p<0.001). Observed mortality for patients receiving surgical treatment was 11% compared to a mean logistic euroSCORE mortality of 16% (NS). The discriminating ability of euroSCORE was good, area under the ROC curve 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.84; p<0.001) logistic model and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.86; p<0.001) additive model.","Cardiac surgery was associated with a good prognosis when indicated regardless of euroSCORE, and surgery should only be withheld after thorough consideration. EuroSCORE remains a valuable tool to identify high-risk IE patients when surgery is considered.",closed_qa
Is culture associated with patient safety in the emergency department?,"To describe the patient safety culture of Dutch emergency departments (EDs), to examine associations between safety culture dimensions and patient safety grades as reported by ED staff and to compare these associations between nurses and physicians. Cross-sectional survey conducted in 2007. Thirty-three non-academic EDs in the Netherlands. Four hundred and eighty nurses, 159 physicians and 91 other professionals. Self-reported level of patient safety. In unadjusted analyses, all dimensions of safety culture were positively associated with the reported level of patient safety and six of these associations with patient safety were statistically significant after adjustment ('teamwork across units', 'frequency of event reporting', communication openness', 'feedback about and learning from errors', 'hospital management support for patient safety'). Differences between nurses and physicians were found on two dimensions ('frequency of event reporting' and ' hospital management support for patient safety'). Physicians tended to grade patient safety higher than nurses whilst having equal judgements on these two dimensions.",Staff identified several dimensions of safety culture that are associated with staff-reported safety in the ED. Physicians and nurses identified distinct dimensions of safety culture as associated with reported level of patient safety.,closed_qa
Is isobaric compliance of the radial artery increased in patients with essential hypertension?,"Hypertension is known to decrease arterial elasticity and systemic compliance. However, the arterial tree is not a homogeneous system, and whether a distal medium-sized artery such as the radial artery behaves like proximal arteries has not been determined. The aims of the present study were, first, to characterize non-invasively the mechanical properties of the radial artery through the determination of the pressure-diameter curve, the distensibility-pressure curve and the compliance-pressure curve, and, secondly, to compare untreated hypertensive patients with normotensive subjects. A new high-precision echo-tracking device was developed which allows the diameter of peripheral arteries to be measured continuously. By relating the changes in internal diameter (cross-sectional changes) to those in blood pressure, the cross-sectional arterial compliance could be determined. Seventy-eight untreated mild or moderate essential hypertensive patients aged 24-78 years were compared with 44 normotensive subjects aged 22-81 years. In order to increase the database and provide independent assessments of the variables examined, the cross-sectional study was performed independently using a standardized procedure in three different research centres. The major finding was that diameter, distensibility and compliance of the radial artery of hypertensive patients were not significantly different from those of normotensive controls when the two populations were studied at their mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, when the two populations were compared for the same level of blood pressure, using distensibility--and compliance--pressure curves, it was clear that isobaric distensibility and compliance of hypertensives were not significantly lower than those of normotensives, being either unchanged or higher.","These findings are in contrast with the well-known decrease in compliance of proximal large arteries due to hypertension. Whether such a difference between proximal large arteries and distal medium-sized arteries may be related to the structural vascular changes observed with long-standing hypertension is still difficult to analyse in humans, and requires further investigation.",closed_qa
Are aDIPOQ and IL6 variants associated with a pro-inflammatory status in obeses with cardiometabolic dysfunction?,"Polymorphisms in genes encoding adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and interleukin-6 (IL6) have been associated with adiposity and obese-related phenotypes. This study investigated the relationship of ADIPOQ and IL6 gene polymorphisms with pro-inflammatory and cardiometabolic markers in obese patients. Anthropometric and body composition parameters were measured in 249 Brazilian subjects (30 to 68 yr). Metabolic and inflammatory markers and adipokines were analyzed in blood samples. ADIPOQ rs2241766 (45 T > G) and IL6 rs1800795 (-174G > C) polymorphisms were analyzed by real-time PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and increased values of waist circumference, body fat, leptin, fibrinogen, IL-1β, hsCRP and TNFα were related to obesity (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation between BMI and waist circumference, body fat, leptin, fibrinogen, PAI-1, IL-1β, hsCRP and TNFα values (p < 0.001) but not with adiponectin. Obese group had altered metabolic status, resistance to leptin and insulin, and atherogenic and pro-inflammatory profiles. ADIPOQ and IL6 variants were not directely related to obesity, leptin resistance or alterations in cardiometabolic markers. Individuals carrying ADIPOQ 45G allele (TG + GG genotype) had higher IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα levels than TT genotype carriers (p < 0.05). IL6 -174GG genotype was associated with increased IL-1β levels (p = 0.033).","Obesity is associated with leptin resistance, cardiometabolic alterations and a pro-inflammatory status. Our results are suggestive that ADIPOQ and IL6 polymorphisms contribute to cardiometabolic risk in obese individuals.",closed_qa
Does cARD9 mediate necrotic smooth muscle cell-induced inflammation in macrophages contributing to neointima formation of vein grafts?,"Inflammation plays an important role in the neointima formation of grafted veins. However, the initiation of inflammation in grafted veins is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of an innate immunity signalling protein, caspase-associated recruitment domain 9 (CARD9) in vein grafts in mice. In early murine vein grafts, we observed robust death of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which was accompanied by infiltration of macrophages and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, SMC necrosis was associated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages in vitro. To explore the mediators of necrotic SMC-induced inflammation in grafted veins from mice, we examined the expression of CARD family proteins and found CARD9 highly expressed in infiltrated macrophages of grafted veins. CARD9-knockout (KO) inhibited necrotic SMC-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and NF-κB activation. Furthermore, CARD9-KO suppressed necrotic SMC-induced expression of VEGF in macrophages. Finally, CARD9-KO decreased neointima formation of grafted veins in mice.",The innate immune protein CARD9 in macrophages may mediate necrotic SMC-induced inflammation by activating NF-κB and contributed to neointima formation in the vein grafts.,closed_qa
Does circulating bile salt-dependent lipase originate from the pancreas via intestinal transcytosis?,"Bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL) has been detected in human blood, where it is assumed to play a substantial role in atherosclerosis. The origin of this circulating enzyme is unknown. The aim of this study was to show that blood BSDL originates from pancreatic exocrine secretions via a transcytotic motion across the intestinal epithelium. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or [(125)I]-labeled human pancreatic BSDL was instilled into the lumen of intestinal loops of the rat, and combined biochemical and immunocytochemical investigations were performed in intestinal cells and in the blood of these animals. In vivo pancreatic BSDL is internalized by duodenal enterocytes. The pancreatic enzyme was associated with microvilli and present in endocytic vesicles and Golgi apparatus as well as along the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. It was also detected in intestinal interstitial spaces. Radiolabeled pancreatic BSDL internalized by the duodenal epithelium is the one further detected in circulation. The radiolabeled protein was immunoprecipitated from plasma and had a 100-kilodalton molecular mass compatible with native pancreatic BSDL. In blood, BSDL was mainly associated with low-density lipoproteins.","These in vivo data show that BSDL, normally present in blood, originates from exocrine pancreatic secretion and support the pathophysiologic relevance of BSDL transcytosis through the intestinal mucosa cell lining. Based on this, the implication of circulating BSDL in atherosclerosis merits careful attention.",closed_qa
Is immunoperoxidase staining for cytokeratins 8 and 18 very sensitive for detection of occult node metastasis of colorectal cancer : a comparison with genetic analysis of K-ras?,"Recent reports suggest that genetic examination of K-ras or p53 mutation is more sensitive for the detection of occult lymph node metastasis in colorectal carcinomas than conventional examination by haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining or immunohistochemistry for gene products. The aim of this study was, first, to define the microscopic characteristics of metastatic cancer cells in lymph nodes stained by the anti-cytokeratin antibody CAM5.2 for cytokeratins 8 and 18, and, second, to compare the detection rate of occult lymph node metastasis for immunohistochemical vs genetic methods. K-ras mutations were first examined in primary tumours of seven cases which showed distant metastasis or local recurrence within 5 years of the initial surgery in spite of the original reporting of no lymph node metastasis by routine H & E staining. K-ras mutations were positive in three cases in primary tumours and lymph nodes, and the remaining four primary tumours were negative for p53 mutation as well as K-ras mutation. Therefore, genetic analysis of occult lymph node metastasis was uninformative, but occult metastasis was detected by cytokeratin staining in two of these four cases. Comparative study of cytokeratin-positive cells was performed on each of the 43 lymph nodes from three cases with K-ras mutations. Cancer cells were detected in 28 of the 43 lymph nodes (65.1%) by cytokeratin staining and in 10 of the 43 corresponding lymph nodes (23.3%) by genetic analysis. Artefactual contamination by cancer cells was present in eight of the 28 cytokeratin positive lymph nodes, and three of the eight nodes were genetically positive.",This study suggests that cytokeratin immunohistochemistry is more sensitive and specific for the detection of occult lymph node metastasis than genetic diagnosis by K-ras mutation in cases with genetic alterations as well as in cases without them.,closed_qa
Cytopathological diagnosis in a cancer registry: a useful diagnostic tool?,"To assess the role of cytology in tumor diagnosis and to explore the potential of this technique to improve tumor registry quality, the authors investigated the role of cytology as a diagnostic tool in registry databases. Through the Italian Network of Cancer Registry (AIRTum) archive, the authors retrieved tumors diagnosed during the years 1983-2002 from several registries, Varese, Torino, Ragusa, Ferrara, Genova, and the Tuscan Cancer Registry. The authors then analyzed the amount of morphological confirmation by topographic code, distinguishing cytological from histological diagnosis. The authors analyzed, only for the Tuscan Cancer Registry, the amount of morphological confirmation by both histological and cytological diagnosis and demonstrated the variation of cytological confirmation with stage of tumor. The better morphological modality for diagnosis was rarely cytology, particularly among lung and pleural tumors; when considered together with histological analysis, cytology examination was often reported in cervical uterine and breast tumors. The usefulness of cytology increases with tumor stage, particularly in sites where biopsy is performed with difficulty.","Cytology may be useful to improve tumoral characterization in advanced stages or in sites inaccessible for histology; moreover, cytology is useful as an initial detector of pathology, prior to histology. A prospect of improvement in diagnostic cytopathology and the use of ancillary techniques, such as molecular biology, could help clinicians and could increase the accuracy of cancer registration.",closed_qa
Is the lack of respiratory gating prejudicial for left breast TomoDirect treatments?,"TomoDirect (TD) can only operate in free-breathing. The purpose of this study is to compare TD with breath-hold 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques for left breast treatments, and to determine if the lack of respiratory gating is a handicap for cardiac sparing. 15 patients treated for left breast had two computed tomography simulation, in free breathing (FB) and in deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH). Four treatments were planned: TD-FB, 3DCRT-FB, 3DCRT-DIBH and IMRT-DIBH. Dose to PTV, heart, lungs, right breast and patient were compared. A slightly lower cardiac mean dose is found for 3DCRT-DIBH than for TD-FB group (1.99Gy Vs 2.89Gy, p=0.0462), while no statistical difference is found for heart V20. TD-FB plans show the best PTV dose homogeneity (0.053, p<0.001) and the lowest left lung mean dose (5.16Gy, p<0.001). No major differences are found for the other organs.","TomoDirect and breath-hold 3DCRT are complementary techniques for left breast treatments: for a minority of patients, respiratory gating is mandatory to lower cardiac dose; for the remaining majority of patients, TomoDirect achieves better PTV homogeneity and reduced left lung dose, with cardiac dose equivalent to 3DCRT-DIBH.",closed_qa
Impaired elastic properties of the ascending aorta in newborns before and early after successful coarctation repair: proof of a systemic vascular disease of the prestenotic arteries?,"Despite successful surgical correction, morbidity of patients with coarctation of the aorta is increased. It is well known that these patients have impaired elastic properties of the prestenotic arteries. To find out whether these abnormalities are primarily present or develop later, we studied 17 newborns before and early after surgical repair. Aortic wall stiffness index and distensibility were calculated using ascending and abdominal aortic diameters determined by M-mode echocardiography and noninvasive estimation of aortic pulse pressure in the right arm and leg. Seventeen patients with aortic coarctation (mean age, 20+/-26 days) were compared with 17 normal neonates (mean age, 13+/-7 days) preoperatively and postoperatively (10+/-6 days after surgery). Ascending aortic distensibility in patients was significantly reduced preoperatively (79+/-58 versus 105+/-36; P=0.03) and postoperatively (65+/-24 versus 105+/-36; P<0.005). Preoperative and postoperative ascending aortic stiffness index was higher in patients (preoperative, 5.2+/-4.4 versus 2.7+/-0.9; P=0.04; postoperative, 4.0+/-1.6 versus 2.7+/-0.9; P<0.005). Elastic properties of the descending aorta did not differ preoperatively or postoperatively compared with those in normal subjects.","Elastic properties of the prestenotic aorta of patients with coarctation seem to be impaired primarily, even in neonates, and remain unchanged early after successful operation. Surgical correction does not resolve inborn pathology of the prestenotic aortic vascular bed.",closed_qa
Is γ-Catenin an independent prognostic marker in early stage colorectal cancer?,"Expression and role of γ-catenin in colorectal carcinogenesis is not well understood. We aimed at characterizing γ-catenin's expression pattern during colorectal carcinogenesis. The expression pattern of γ-catenin was characterized in adenomas, primary colorectal carcinomas, and their corresponding metastases. Since this descriptive immunohistochemical analysis revealed upregulation of γ-catenin in the invasive front of both primary tumors and metastases, a tissue microarray (TMA) was performed, allowing for correlation of subcellular expression patterns with disease recurrence and cancer-specific survival. Comparison of γ-catenin expression with that of β-catenin was performed. In normal colonic epithelium and adenomas, γ-catenin was weakly expressed at the membrane. In central areas of primary colorectal carcinomas, membranous and cytoplasmatic expression was present, with cytoplasmatic and nuclear upregulation of γ-catenin in the invasive fronts. Expression patterns found in metastases resembled those of their respective primary tumors. Subsequent TMA analysis showed that upregulation of cytoplasmatic γ-catenin in the invasive fronts of curatively resected early T2 and T3 colorectal carcinomas was associated with shortened disease-free survival and an increased risk of death (p=0.003; hazard ratio = 2.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-6.18).",The correlation of upregulated cellular γ-catenin levels with higher recurrences and impaired survival suggests a tumor promoting role of γ-catenin in colorectal cancer. γ-Catenin may therefore serve as a marker for identifying patients who are at increased risk of disease recurrence who may benefit from closer follow-up and adjuvant therapy.,closed_qa
Does gambogic acid exhibit anti-psoriatic efficacy through inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammation?,"Psoriasis is a chronic T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease. Studies have shown that angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Studies have also indicated that Gambogic acid (GA) inhibits angiogenesis and may be a viable drug candidate in anti-angiogenesis therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-psoriatic effect of GA and the possible mechanisms. MTT test on HaCaT cells and immunofluorescence on HUVEC cells were processed. An O/W cream of GA was prepared and topically applied to the ears of K14-VEGF transgenic mice and psoriasis-like guinea-pigs, and the tail skin of Balb/C mice independently. Furthermore, hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissues from three models and immunohistochemistry staining of ear samples from K14-VEGF mice were performed. In vitro, GA inhibited proliferation of HaCaTs and TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB in HUVECs. In vivo, animals treated with GA showed significant morphological and histological improvements. Immunohistochemical analysis of K14-VEGF transgenic mice revealed that hyperplastic and inflamed vessels were suppressed with GA treatment. The expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and E-selectin was significantly decreased. GA inhibited angiogenesis and the expression of VEGFR2 and p-VEGFR2. T lymphocyte infiltration and the expression of IL-17 and IL-22 were also reduced by GA treatment.","Our results suggest that GA has anti-psoriatic efficacy through inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammation. Therefore, GA is attractive and offers future potential for application in patients with psoriasis.",closed_qa
Is ambulatory blood pressure superior to clinic blood pressure in predicting treatment-induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy . SAMPLE Study Group . Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation?,"In cross-sectional studies, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) correlates more closely than clinic BP with the organ damage of hypertension. Whether ABP predicts development or regression of organ damage over time better than clinic BP, however, is unknown. In 206 essential hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we measured clinic supine BP, 24-hour ABP, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI, echocardiography) before and after 12 months of treatment with lisinopril (20 mg UID) without or with hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 or 25 mg UID). Measurements included random-zero, clinic orthostatic, and home BP. In all, 184 subjects completed the 12-month treatment period. Before treatment, clinic supine BP was 165 +/- 15/105 +/- 5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic), 24-hour average BP was 149 +/- 16/95 +/- 11 mm Hg, and LVMI was 158 +/- 32 g/m2. At the end of treatment, they were 139 +/- 12/87 +/- 7 mm Hg, 131 +/- 12/83 +/- 10 mm Hg, and 133 +/- 26 g/m2, respectively (P < .01 for all). Before treatment, LVMI did not correlate with clinic BP, but it showed a correlation with systolic and diastolic 24-hour average BP (r = .34/.27, P < .01). The LVMI reduction was not related to the reduction in clinic BP, but it was related to the reduction in 24-hour average BP (r = .42/.38, P < .01). Treatment-induced changes in average daytime and nighttime BPs correlated with LVMI changes as strongly as 24-hour BP changes. No substantial advantage over clinic supine BP was shown by clinic orthostatic, random-zero, and home BP.","In hypertensive subjects with LVH, regression of LVH was predicted much more closely by treatment-induced changes in ABP than in the clinic BP. This provides the first longitudinally controlled evidence that ABP may be clinically superior to traditional BP measurements.",closed_qa
Do perspectives of US military commanders on tobacco use and tobacco control policy?,"Tobacco use among members of the US military service is unacceptably high, resulting in substantial healthcare and personnel costs. Support of military command is critical to the success of tobacco control policies because line commanders are responsible for implementation and enforcement. This study is the first to examine US military line commanders' perspectives about current tobacco control policies and the impact of tobacco on readiness. We conducted key-informant interviews with 20 officers at the US Army's Command and General Staff College about military tobacco use and tobacco control policy. Participants identified the long-term impact of tobacco use on military members, but were unaware of proximal effects on health and readiness other than lost productivity due to smoke breaks. Officers also discussed nicotine addiction and the logistics of ensuring that an addicted population had access to tobacco. Regarding policy, most knew about regulations governing smoke-free areas and were open to stronger restrictions, but were unaware of current policies governing prevention, intervention and product sales.","Findings suggest that strong policy that takes advantage of the hierarchical and disciplined nature of the military, supported by senior line and civilian leadership up to and including the secretaries of the services and the Secretary of Defense, will be critical to substantially diminishing tobacco use by military personnel.",closed_qa
Does high fructose diet increase mortality in hypertensive rats compared to a complex carbohydrate or high fat diet?,"Chronic hypertension leads to cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and premature death. Little is known about the impact of dietary macronutrient composition on hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy and mortality. We investigated the effects of consuming either a high complex carbohydrate diet, a high simple sugar diet, or a high fat diet on cardiac hypertrophy and mortality in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats. Rats were assigned to four diets: complex carbohydrate (CC; 70% starch, 10% fat, 20% protein by energy), high fat (FAT; 20% carbohydrates, 60% fat, 20% protein), high fructose (FRU; 70% fructose, 10% fat, 20% protein), and ""western"" (WES; 35% fructose, 45% fat, 20% protein). Hypertension was initiated by adding 6% NaCl (+S) to the chow of half the animals within each diet (n = 10 to 13/group). Tail cuff blood pressure measurements were assessed after 5 and 11 weeks of treatment, and echocardiography were assessed after 12 weeks of treatment. All rats fed a high salt diet had similar levels of hypertension (CC+S 220 +/-2 mm Hg, FAT+S 221 +/- 3 mm Hg, FRU+S 221 +/- 1 mm Hg, WES+S 226 +/- 3 mm Hg). Echocardiography results show that the addition of salt to FRU resulted in increased regional wall thickness that was not observed in other dietary groups. All rats fed a low salt diet (CC, FAT, FRU, WES) and the FAT+S group survived 90 days. On the other hand, there was 90-day mortality in the WES+S group (18% mortality) and the CC+S group (30% mortality). In addition, FRU+S rats started dying after 45 days of salt feeding, and only 15% survived the full 90 days.","These results demonstrate that a high fructose diet consumed during hypertension increases mortality and left ventricular (LV) wall thickness compared to either a high fat, high starch, or a ""western"" diet.",closed_qa

Is collagen type 1 ( COL1A1 ) Sp1 binding site polymorphism associated with osteoporotic fractures but not with bone density in post-menopausal women from the Canary Islands : a preliminary study?,"An association between the polymorphism for transcription factor Sp1 in the gene COL1A1 and low bone density (BMD) and osteoporotic fractures has been described but not confirmed for all races and ages. The aim of this preliminary work was to ascertain whether this association is present in women from the Canary Islands. Polymerase chain reaction RFLP was used to determine COL1A1 polymorphism Sp1 in 199 consecutive outpatient post-menopausal Caucasian women from the Canary Islands, aged 50-70 years. BMD was measured at lumbar spine and hip by DXA and at third lumbar vertebrae by QCT. Prevalent vertebral fractures were recorded on standard lateral X-ray film. Non-vertebral osteoporotic fractures were registered by medical record and self-reported history. Biochemical markers (serum osteocalcin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase), blood calcium and phosphate were also assessed. Distribution genotypes were 113 (50.8%) GG homozygotes, 73 (36.7%) Ss heterozygotes and 7 (3.5%) TT homozygotes. All patients with osteoporotic fractures carried the GG allele more frequently than TT homozygotic women. The odds ratio was 3.01 (95% CI 1.6-5.7) for prevalent vertebral fractures (n=62) and 2.33 (95% CI 1.2-4.4) for all osteoporotic fractures (n=65) for the T-carrying allele vs TT homozygotic women. There was no difference in BMD measured by DXA or QCT, nor in bone markers, blood calcium or phosphate.","This preliminary study confirmed that the presence of at least one copy of the T allele is associated with osteoporotic fractures, but not with low BMD, in women from the Canary Islands.",closed_qa
Does transurethral resection of the prostate facilitate detection of clinically significant prostate cancer that is missed with systematic sextant and transition zone biopsies?,"A prospective study was conducted to determine whether transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) facilitates detection of prostate cancer that is missed with systematic sextant biopsies associated with transition zone (TZ) biopsies. A total of 139 consecutive patients underwent transperineal TZ biopsies of each lobe in addition to a transrectal systematic sextant peripheral zone (PZ) biopsy. Patients whose biopsies were negative for cancer received TURP for relief of lower urinary tract obstruction when indicated. Cancer was detected in biopsy specimens of 40 patients. Of these cancers, 18 originated in the PZ alone and 22 were located both in the TZ and the PZ. No cancers were detected in the TZ alone. Of 99 patients who were proven not to have cancer by the biopsies, 18 were indicated for TURP. Five of these patients (28%) had cancer in the resected tissues. All cancers were clinically organ confined and their Gleason sum scores were 2-5. Cancer-positive chips accounted for less than 10% of all resected specimens. Of the 66 patients with negative biopsies and without indication for TURP, four (6%) were revealed to have an elevation of the serum PSA level during follow up. They were later proven to have cancer by a second biopsy.","Routine use of TZ biopsy is not warranted for detection of cancer. Transurethral resection of the prostate can detect cancers in patients with negative PZ and TZ biopsies. However, cancers detected by TURP may not always be clinically significant and only four of 66 patients who were not indicated for TURP and received a close follow up were later found to have cancer, although their follow-up period was short. Thus, it still remains to be elucidated whether TURP is necessary for all patients with negative biopsies of the prostate.",closed_qa
Different bleeding patterns with the use of levonorgestrel intrauterine system: are they associated with changes in uterine artery blood flow?,"Evaluate if different bleeding patterns associated with the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) are associated with different uterine and endometrial vascularization patterns, as evidenced by ultrasound power Doppler analysis. A longitudinal study, with each subject acting as its own control was conducted between January 2010 and December 2012. Healthy volunteers with a history of heavy but cyclic and regular menstrual cycles were enrolled in the study. Ultrasonographic examination was performed before and after six months of LNG-IUS placement: uterine volume, endometrial thickness, and subendometrial and myometrial Doppler blood flow patterns have been evaluated. A total of 32 women were enrolled out of 186 initially screened. At six months of follow-up, all subjects showed a reduction in menstrual blood loss; for analysis, they were retrospectively divided into 3 groups: normal cycling women (Group I), amenorrheic women (Group II), and women with prolonged bleedings (Group III). Intergroup analysis documented a statistically significant difference in endometrial thickness among the three groups; in addition, mean pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) in the spiral arteries were significantly lower in Group I and Group III compared to Group II. This difference persisted also when comparing--within subjects of Group III--mean PI and RI mean values before and after insertion.","The LNG-IUS not only altered endometrial thickness, but--in women with prolonged bleedings--also significantly changed uterine artery blood flow. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and enable gynecologists to properly counsel women, improving initial continuation rates.",closed_qa
Does phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate potentiate the vasodilative properties of nebivolol in rat aorta?,"Sildenafil citrate (SIL) is contraindicated in patients with coronary heart disease who are treated with nitric oxide (NO) donators such as organic nitrates, as it potentiates NO-mediated vasodilation. The present study investigated whether SIL also affects the vasodilatory effects of nebivolol (NEB), a selective beta1-adrenoceptor blocker with an additional, endothelium-dependent NO-liberating property, in comparison to the combination SIL/glycerol trinitrate (GTN). Experiments were performed in isolated vessel rings of rat aorta (Wistar rats, 8-12 weeks), which had been pre-contracted with phenylephrine (10(-5) M). Isometric tension was measured by a force transducer, and cumulative concentration-response curves were obtained for each drug. The rank order of vasodilatory potency as measured by the concentration needed to achieve 50% relaxation (EC50) was GTN (0.08 microM) > SIL (1.25 microM) > or = NEB (3.5 microM). In the presence of both therapeutic (1 nM) and high (1 microM) concentrations of SIL, vasodilation of GTN was potentiated as indicated by a significant increase in vasodilatory potency (EC50 GTN + low SIL: 0.019 microM, EC50 GTN + high SIL: 0.002 microM; both P < 0.01 vs. GTN). In contrast, SIL did not potentiate the vasodilatory effect of NEB (EC50 NEB + low SIL: 5.01 microM, EC50 NEB + high SIL: 3.2 microM; n.s. vs. NEB).",These data demonstrate that SIL does not potentiate NEB-induced vasodilation in vitro. These findings indicate that the interaction between SIL and NO-donators/organic nitrates does not apply to the NO-liberating properties of NEB. Our findings suggest that SIL may safely be used in hypertensive patients treated with NEB.,closed_qa
Do effect of apical preparation size and preparation taper on irrigant volume delivered by using negative pressure irrigation system?,"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect that apical preparation size and preparation taper had on the volume of irrigant delivered to the working length of a root canal preparation in a clinically relevant amount of time. Forty intact human single-rooted teeth were randomly distributed into 2 separate phases. The first phase aimed to determine the smaller apical size that will allow more volume of irrigant at working length. All samples had the same taper and were sequentially instrumented to sizes of 30.06, 35.06, 40.06, and 45.06. The second phase aimed to determine the taper that will allow more volume of irrigant at working length. Teeth were sequentially instrumented to 40.02, 40.04, 40.06, and 40.08. All samples were irrigated by using the micro-cannula, and the volume of sodium hypochlorite suctioned at working length under negative pressure was measured during a period of 30 seconds by using a custom recovery device. An increase in size from ISO #35 to ISO #40 resulted in a percentage gain of approximately 44% in mean irrigant volume, whereas an increase in size from ISO #40 to ISO #45 resulted in a percentage gain of approximately 4%. An increase in taper from 0.02 through 0.08 resulted in percentage gains of approximately 74%, 5.4%, and 2.4% increase, respectively.","The data demonstrated that an increase in apical preparation size and taper resulted in a statistically significant increase in the volume of irrigant. In addition, an apical enlargement to ISO #40 with a 0.04 taper will allow for tooth structure preservation and maximum volume of irrigation at the apical third when using the apical negative pressure irrigation system.",closed_qa
Is normalization of widespread pressure pain hypersensitivity after total hip replacement in patients with hip osteoarthritis associated with clinical and functional improvements?,"To evaluate the relevance of ongoing nociceptive joint inputs to the maintenance of widespread pain hypersensitivity in patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and to determine whether a reversal in the widespread pressure hypersensitivity together with an improvement in pain and function occurs after total hip replacement in these patients. Forty patients with hip OA participated. Twenty patients underwent total hip replacement, and the other 20 patients were assigned to a waiting list. Pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs) over the second metacarpal bone and the gluteus medius, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and tibialis anterior muscles were assessed bilaterally with a pressure algometer before and 3 months after total hip replacement surgery. Assessments of pain intensity (by visual analog scale [VAS]), physical function (by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), and health status (by the Short Form 12 health survey and the EuroQol 5-domain index) were also performed. Patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty exhibited a reduction in widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia (increases in PPTs) over local and distant pain-free areas, as compared with before surgery and as compared with the patients assigned to the waiting list. PPTs were related to hip pain intensity, and significant correlations were found between higher VAS scores and lower average PPTs over all points assessed (-0.409 < r < -0.306, P < 0.05). Patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty exhibited a greater decrease in pain intensity and greater increases in function and health status than did those who were on the waiting list. Changes in the intensity of hip pain were moderately associated with changes in pressure pain sensitivity in the hip arthroplasty group.","Normalization of widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia was found after successful hip joint replacement in patients with hip OA. Altered pain processing seems to be driven by ongoing peripheral joint pathology, which stresses the importance of reducing pain in OA.",closed_qa
Do ePHA2 MUTATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO CONGENITAL CATARACT THROUGH DIVERSE MECHANISMS?,"Congenital cataract is a leading cause of childhood blindness. Mutations in the EPHA2 gene are one of the causes of inherited congenital cataract. The EPHA2 gene encodes a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor and is highly expressed in epithelial cells, including in the ocular lens. Signaling through the EPHA2 receptor plays a pivotal role in epithelial cell homeostasis. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of congenital cataract causing mutations in the EPHA2 gene on the encoded protein in epithelial cells. The effect of five disease-causing mutations, p.P584L (c.1751C>T), p.T940I (c.2819C>T), p.D942fsXC71 (c.2826-9G>A), p.A959T (c.2875G>A), and p.V972GfsX39 (c.2915_2916delTG), on localization of the protein was examined in two in vitro epithelial cell culture systems: Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) epithelial cells. Myc-tagged mutant constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis. The Myc-tagged wild-type construct was used as a control. The Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins were ectopically expressed and detected by immunofluorescence labeling. Two of the mutations, p.T940I and p.D942fsXC71, located within the cytoplasmic sterile-α-motif (SAM) domain of EPHA2, led to mis-localization of the protein to the perinuclear space and co-localization with the cis-golgi apparatus, indicating sub-organellar/cellular retention of the mutant proteins. The mutant proteins carrying the remaining three mutations, similar to the wild-type EPHA2, localized to the cell membrane.",Mis-localization of two of the mutant proteins in epithelial cells suggests that some disease-causing mutations in EPHA2 likely affect lens epithelial cell homeostasis and contribute to cataract. This study suggests that mutations in EPHA2 contribute to congenital cataract through diverse mechanisms.,closed_qa
"Is nR5A1 a novel disease gene for 46 , XX testicular and ovotesticular disorders of sex development?","We aimed to identify the genetic cause in a cohort of 11 unrelated cases and two sisters with 46,XX SRY-negative (ovo)testicular disorders of sex development (DSD). Whole-exome sequencing (n = 9), targeted resequencing (n = 4), and haplotyping were performed. Immunohistochemistry of sex-specific markers was performed on patients' gonads. The consequences of mutation were investigated using luciferase assays, localization studies, and RNA-seq. We identified a novel heterozygous NR5A1 mutation, c.274C>T p.(Arg92Trp), in three unrelated patients. The Arg92 residue is highly conserved and located in the Ftz-F1 region, probably involved in DNA-binding specificity and stability. There were no consistent changes in transcriptional activation or subcellular localization. Transcriptomics in patient-derived lymphocytes showed upregulation of MAMLD1, a direct NR5A1 target previously associated with 46,XY DSD. In gonads of affected individuals, ovarian FOXL2 and testicular SRY-independent SOX9 expression observed.","We propose NR5A1, previously associated with 46,XY DSD and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency, as a novel gene for 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD. We hypothesize that p.(Arg92Trp) results in decreased inhibition of the male developmental pathway through downregulation of female antitestis genes, thereby tipping the balance toward testicular differentiation in 46,XX individuals. In conclusion, our study supports a role for NR5A1 in testis differentiation in the XX gonad.Genet Med advance online publication 04 August 2016Genetics in Medicine (2016); doi:10.1038/gim.2016.118.",closed_qa
Is δNp73β oncogenic in hepatocellular carcinoma by blocking apoptosis signaling via death receptors and mitochondria?,"p73 belongs to the p53 family of transcription factors known to regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. The Trp73 gene has two promoters that drive the expression of two major p73 isoform subfamilies: TA and ΔN. In general, TAp73 isoforms show proapoptotic activities, whereas members of the N-terminally truncated (ΔN) p73 subfamily that lack the transactivation domain show antiapoptotic functions. We found that upregulation of ΔNp73 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlated with reduced survival. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms accounting for the oncogenic role of ΔNp73 in HCC. ΔNp73β can directly interfere with the transcriptional activation function of the TA (containing the transactivation domain) isoforms of the p53 family and consequently inhibit transactivation of proapoptotic target genes. Interference of ΔNp73β with apoptosis-/chemosensitivity takes place at several levels of apoptosis signaling. ΔNp73β negatively regulates the genes encoding for the death receptors CD95, TNF-R1, TRAIL-R2 and TNFRSF18. Furthermore, ΔNp73β represses the genes encoding caspase-2, -3, -6, -8 and -9. Concomitantly, ΔNp73β inhibits apoptosis emanating from mitochondria.","Thus, ΔNp73 expression in HCC selects against both the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptosis activity of the TA isoforms. Our data suggest that ΔNp73 isoforms repress apoptosis-related genes of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways thereby contributing to chemoresistance. The clinical importance of these data is evidenced by our finding that the ΔNp73ß target gene signature can predict the prognosis of patients suffering from HCC.",closed_qa
Cerebral blood volume measurements by perfusion-weighted MR imaging in gliomas: ready for prime time in predicting short-term outcome and recurrent disease?,"Current classification and grading of primary brain tumors has significant limitations. Our aim was to determine whether the relative cerebral volume (rCBV) measurements in gliomas may serve as an adjunct to histopathologic grading, with a hypothesis that rCBV values are more accurate in predicting 1-year survival and recurrence. Thirty-four patients with gliomas (WHO grade I-IV, 27 astrocytomas, 7 tumors with oligodendroglial components) underwent contrast-enhanced MR rCBV measurements before treatment. The region of interest and the single pixel with the maximum CBV value within the tumors were normalized relative to the contralateral normal tissue (rCBV(mean) and rCBV(max), respectively). Karnofsky performance score and progression-free survival (PFS) were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were conducted for CBV and histologic grade (WHO grade). Significant correlations were detected only when patients with oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas were excluded. The rCBV(mean) and rCBV(max) in the astrocytomas were 3.5 +/- 2.9 and 3.7 +/- 2.7. PFS correlated with rCBV parameters (r = -0.54 to -0.56, P<or = .009). WHO grade correlated with rCBV values (r = 0.65, P<or = .0002). rCBV(max)>4.2 was found to be a significant cutoff value for recurrence prediction with 77.8% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity (P = .0001). rCBV(max)<or = 3.8 was a significant predictor for 1-year survival (93.7% sensitivity, 72.7% specificity, P = .0002). The relative risk for shorter PFS was 11.1 times higher for rCBV(max)>4.2 (P = .0006) and 6.7 times higher for WHO grade>II (P = .05). The combined CBV-WHO grade classification enhanced the predictive value for recurrence/progression (P<.0001).",rCBV values in astrocytomas but not tumors with oligodendroglial components are predictive for recurrence and 1-year survival and may be more accurate than histopathologic grading.,closed_qa
Does [ Activated autophagy in spinal cord contribute to maintaining diabetic neuropathic pain in rats model ]?,"To observe the role of autophagy in maintaining diabetic neuropathic pain in rats model. A total of 44 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into diabetic neuropathic (n = 36) and normal control (n = 8) groups. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg body weight, i.p) freshly dissolved in citrate buffer (pH = 4.5). For assessing the presence of mechanical hyperalgesia in diabetic rats, mechanical paw-withdrawal threshold (MWT) in response to punctuate mechanical stimuli was measured. At Week 4 post-injection, the rats with mechanical pain threshold decreasing over 50% as compared to baseline were designated as diabetic neuropathic pain rats. They were randomly divided into three groups of neuropathic pain (DP), neuropathic pain plus rapamycin (DR) and neuropathic pain plus 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (DA). The DR group received an intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin (1 mg/kg body weight) for Day 1 to Day 14 after grouping. At the same timepoint, the DA group had an intraperitoneal injection of 3-MA (2 mg/kg body weight) and the other group phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (1 ml/kg body weight). MWT was measured at week 1, 2, 3, 4 after STZ injection and at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14 after rapamycin, 3-MA or PBS injections. Spinal cord tissues were used to examine the expression of LC3, Beclin-1 and P62 protein by Western blot at Day 14 after medication. The mechanical threshold of group DR decreased further from Day 3 to Day 14 after rapamycin injection compared to baseline [(4.8±0.8), (4.3±0.7), (4.1±0.6), (3.6±0.5), (3.3±0.6) vs (5.3±0.9) g, P<0.05]. The mechanical threshold of group DA began to increase from Day 5 to Day 14 after 3-MA injection [(7.0±0.8), (7.7±1.0), (9.1±0.9), (9.6±1.1) vs (5.3±0.6) g, P<0.05]. The expressions of LC3-II and Beclin-1 protein in spinal cord of rapamycin-treated rats was significantly higher than those of non-supplemented diabetics (1.32±0.12 vs 1.02±0.11; 1.03±0.08 vs 0.80±0.06, P<0.05). Otherwise the expressions of these protein in spinal cord of 3-MA-treated rats were significantly lower than those of non-supplemented diabetics (0.70±0.09 vs 1.02±0.11; 0.55±0.05 vs 0.80±0.06, P<0.05).",Up-regulated autophagy in spinal cord partially contributes to the maintenance of diabetic neuropathic pain.,closed_qa
Does siRNA-mediated downregulation of TC21 sensitize esophageal cancer cells to cisplatin?,"To determine the functional significance of TC21 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). TC21 siRNA transfection was carried out using Hyperfectamine to knock down TC21, and transcripts were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein by Western blotting. We demonstrated the effect of TC21 downregulation of cell signaling in esophageal cancer cells by assessing the phosphorylation status of its downstream targets, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), protein kinase B (pAkt), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and cyclinD1 using specific antibodies. Cell survival analysis after cisplatin treatment was carried out by cell viability assay and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. TC21 knockdown in human ESCC cell line TE13 cells, showed only a marginal increase (14.2%) in cell death compared with control cells. The expressions of the signaling proteins PI3K and pAkt, transcription factor NF-κB, and cell cycle protein cyclin D1 were markedly decreased in response to TC21 downregulation, whereas the level of pPTEN, an antagonist of PI3K, was increased. In addition, we evaluated the potential of TC21 as a putative target for sensitizing ESCC cells to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Increased cell death (38.4%) was observed in cells treated with cisplatin after TC21 knockdown compared with cells which were treated with cisplatin alone (20% cell death).","Results suggest that TC21 mediates its effects via the PI3K-Akt pathway, NF-κB and cyclin D1, and enhances chemoresistance in esophageal cancer cells.",closed_qa
Is mVP expression related to IGF1-R in cervical carcinoma patients treated by radiochemotherapy?,"To assess the expression of MVP in cervix carcinoma patients treated by radiochemotherapy, its relation to clinical and pathologic prognostic factors and its role in predicting clinical outcome. In addition the relation to IGF-1R expression in this cohort of patients will be explored. Sixty consecutive patients suffering from localized cervix carcinoma were prospectively included in this study from July 1999 to December 2003. Follow-up was closed in November 2007. Patients were staged following the TNM classification. All patients received pelvic radiation (45-64.80 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions) followed brachytherapy and concomitant cisplatin at 40 mg/m(2)/week doses. MVP expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. MVP was expressed in 58 patients (96.7%) and no relation was found with clinicopathological variables. High MVP expression was related to high IGF1-R expression (p=0.023). Complete response after treatment was observed in 50 patients (83.3%). Clinical stage of the disease and clinical response to radiochemotherapy were the most important prognostic factors related to survival. High MVP and IGF-1R tumour expression was strongly related to poor local and regional disease-free survival (p=0.006), distant disease-free survival (p=0.050), disease-free survival (p=0.006), and cause-specific survival (p=0.007) in patients achieving a complete response.",MVP and IGF-1R expression were related in clinical cervical tumours and confer reduced long-term local control in patients who achieved clinical complete response to radiochemotherapy.,closed_qa
Does preoperative supplementation with a carbohydrate mixture decrease organ dysfunction-associated risk factors?,"Recently, both asymmetrical dimethylarginine and IL-6 have been suggested to be associated with the induction and severity of single and multiple organ dysfunction. The aims of the present study were to elucidate if these factors were increased in an ischemia reperfusion (IR) model and whether pre-operative carbohydrate supplementation can reduce the risk factors along with the IR injury. One group of male Wistar rats was fasted for 16 h (water ad libitum) prior to clamping the superior mesenteric artery (IR fasted n=14). A second group had ad libitum access to a carbohydrate solution prior to clamping (IR fasted CHO group n=11). Sham-fasted animals, which only received laparotomy and no clamping, served as controls (n=4). Plasma urea and ALAT activity were both increased in the IR fasted animals when compared to the sham rats (P=0.007 and P<0.02, respectively). Furthermore, it was shown that IR fasted rats had increased ADMA and IL-6 concentration in plasma when compared to sham animals (P<0.02). Moreover, the GSH level in lung was significantly decreased in the IR fasted animals (P=0.014). IR CHO supplemented showed no significant increase of ALAT activity and decrease of lung GSH. Furthermore, significantly lower plasma urea, ADMA and IL-6 concentration was seen in the IR CHO supplemented group when compared to the IR fasted rats (P=0.028, P<0.01 and P<0.02, respectively). The liver glycogen concentration in IR fasted rats was 48% of that IR rats supplemented the carbohydrate mixture.","The present rat intestinal ischemia reperfusion model not only induces organ injury indicated by the classical parameters such as plasma urea and ALAT activity, but also increased plasma IL-6 and ADMA and decreased lung GSH concentration in IR fasted rats. Pre-operative supplementation with the carbohydrate mixture significantly lowered the plasma urea, IL-6 and ADMA concentrations and maintained lung GSH concentration. This indicates that pre-operative carbohydrate supplementation reduces post-operative organ injury.",closed_qa
Does chronic exposure to lidocaine alter flux through sodium channels in cultured neuronal cells?,"Although tachyphylaxis to local anesthetics has been reported in the clinical literature for more than two decades, the molecular mechanism(s) remain unknown. The authors described an attempt to create an in vitro model for tachyphylaxis to local anesthetics using cultured neuronal cells. Murine neuroblastoma cells (N1E115) and rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12) were grown in the presence or absence of lidocaine or tetrodotoxin for between 1 and 14 days. Thereafter, the authors tested flux through sodium channels by measuring total and tetrodotoxin-sensitive flux of 14C-labeled guanidinium (a ligand for the sodium channel) into the cells using the technique of Jacques et al. Chronic lidocaine or tetrodotoxin treatment caused no change relative to control cells in total or tetrodotoxin-sensitive guanidinium flux, or in the subsequent ability of lidocaine in the flux assay mixture to inhibit guanidinium flux.","The authors concluded that chronic lidocaine or tetrodotoxin application did not produce changes in stimulated sodium channel activity or subsequent lidocaine susceptibility in this model. To the extent that this model simulated the clinical situation, mechanisms other than up-regulation of sodium channel number or maximal stimulated flux per channel may have been responsible for producing tachyphylaxis.",closed_qa
Is high plasma renin activity combined with elevated urinary albumin excretion in essential hypertensive patients?,"Several studies suggest that the hyperactivity of the circulating renin-angiotensin system might favor the progression of renal disease in essential hypertension. To elucidate this aspect, we investigated the relationship between plasma renin activity (PRA) and the urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER), an early marker of hypertension-related renal changes, in human essential hypertension. Ninety nonobese, nondiabetic, nonhyperlipidemic patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (67 males, 23 females; mean age 51.4 +/- 6.2 years) were divided into low renin (LR), normal renin (NR), and high renin (HR) subgroups according to individual PRA while they were on a constant NaCl intake (120 mmol NaCl/day). The UAER was assessed during the same NaCl intake. Data showed significantly higher UAER (31.3 +/- 12.9 microg/min) in HR (N = 30) than NR (N = 30, 22.7 +/- 14.4 microg/min, P < 0.02) and LR patients (N = 30, 21.7 +/- 10.8 microg/min, P < 0. 01).","Our study demonstrates that the UAER is elevated in HR essential hypertensive patients, suggesting that high PRA accelerates the onset of early renal changes in human essential hypertension.",closed_qa
Are patients with long-term control of systemic disease a favorable prognostic group for treatment of brain metastases with SRS alone?,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone is an attractive option for treatment of brain metastases that avoids whole brain irradiation (WBRT)-associated morbidity, but is limited by regional CNS failures and short survival in some patients. We evaluated a subgroup of patients with controlled systemic disease that may represent a favorable patient population for SRS alone. All patients with brain metastases treated with SRS without WBRT at our institution between 2004 and 2014 were grouped into two cohorts, those with controlled systemic disease for ≥1yr (CSD) prior to presentation with brain metastases and those without (USD). Rates of local and regional CNS failure, and overall survival were assessed with chi-square and Student's t tests. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate independent predictors of regional control and overall survival. A total of 294 patients underwent SRS to 697 lesions, of which 65 patients had CSD. Median follow-up was 9.7 mos. There was no difference in local control between the two cohorts (p=0.795). Regional CNS control was significantly better for patients with CSD, 68% vs. 48% (p=0.001). Overall survival at 1 and 5 years for CSD were 65% and 13%, with USD yielding 41% and 7% (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that USD (relative CSD) independently predicts regional failure (HR1.75; p=0.008) and shorter overall survival (HR1.55; p=0.007).","Patients presenting with brain metastases after ≥1 year of primary and systemic disease control represent a particularly favorable cohort, with lower regional CNS failure and prolonged survival, for an approach of SRS alone.",closed_qa
Is a scanning microscopic clue to the diagnosis of arthropod assault reaction : alteration of interstitial tissue more common than a wedge-shaped inflammatory infiltrate?,"A scanning microscopic clue to the diagnosis of arthropod assault reactions is a wedge-shaped inflammatory infiltrate. However, to describe an inflammatory infiltrate as wedge-shaped or not involves a high degree of subjectivity. We studied hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of 137 biopsies of arthropod assault reactions for epidermal and dermal changes and for the composition, density and depth of the inflammatory infiltrate. We found a wedge-shaped inflammatory component in only 10.2% of the cases. A much more common feature is an alteration of the interstitial tissue present in 85.4% of the biopsies. It consisted of a narrowing of the spaces between the collagen bundles, which was readily observable on scanning magnification. On higher magnification, a loosely textured basophilic material was often noted within the dermis.",The hitherto often emphasized wedge-shaped configuration of the inflammatory component of arthropod assault reactions is not of great diagnostic value. The altered interstitial tissue is easily recognizable by its diminished interstitial spaces at low power magnification and can serve as a scanning magnification clue to the diagnosis of arthropod assault reactions.,closed_qa
Does inhibition of p21-Activated Kinase 1 by IPA-3 promote Locomotor Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury in Mice?,"Ninety-six male adult CD-1 mice were randomly divided into sham, spinal cord injury (SCI) + vehicle, and SCI + IPA-3 groups. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, production of tumor necrosis factors (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, tissue edema, blood-spinal cord barrier penetrability, neural cell apoptosis, and neurological function recovery were measured. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of specific inhibition of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) by IPA-3 on SCI and the underlying mechanisms thereof. SCI is a devastating clinical condition that may result in long-lasting and deteriorating functional deficits. The major goal of SCI treatment is to limit the development of secondary injury. IPA-3, a PAK1 inhibitor, exhibited neuroprotection against secondary damage after traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). MMP-2, MMP-9, and cleaved caspase-3 expression were assessed by Western blot. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The blood-spinal cord barrier disruption was measured by water content and Evans blue extravasation of the spinal cord. Neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by Nissl staining and Terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl Transferase Mediated Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assay. The locomotor behavior of hind limb was evaluated by Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-injury. Compared with SCI + vehicle mice, IPA-3 treatment showed decreased p-PAK1, MMP-2, MMP-9, cleaved caspase-3, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression. Moreover, inhibition of PAK1 by IPA-3 reduced spinal cord water content and Evans blue extravasation, increased neuronal survival, and reduced TUNEL-positive cells at 24 hours after SCI. Furthermore, IPA-3 improved spinal cord functional recovery 7 days after SCI.","Inhibition of PAK1 by IPA-3 promoted recovery of neurological function, possibly by downregulating the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Our data suggest that PAK1 may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with SCI.",closed_qa
"Blood pressure, white matter lesions and medial temporal lobe atrophy: closing the gap between vascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease?","Vascular factors are recognized as important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, although it is unknown whether these factors directly lead to the typical degenerative pathology such as medial temporal lobe atrophy. We set out to investigate the relation between blood pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy in patients with senile and presenile Alzheimer's disease with or without white matter lesions. We determined the relation between blood pressure and pulse pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI in 159 patients with Alzheimer's disease, stratified on white matter lesions and age at onset of dementia. There was a linear relation between systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (both in tertiles) and the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy (p(trend) = 0.05 and p(trend) 0.03, respectively). A significant relation was found between pulse pressure [beta = 0.08 (95% CI: 0.00-0.15; p = 0.05) per 10 mm Hg] and (borderline significant) systolic blood pressure [beta = 0.05 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.11; p = 0.1) per 10 mm Hg]and medial temporal lobe atrophy. White matter lesions and age-stratified analysis revealed a significant association between systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy, only in the subsample with white matter lesions and in the subsample with a senile onset of dementia. The relations were independent of severity of dementia and diabetes mellitus.","Systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, especially in the presence of white matter lesions and in patients with a late onset of dementia. Our finding may be another step in providing a rationale on how vascular factors could ultimately result in Alzheimer's disease.",closed_qa
Are gender differences in the motivational processing of babies determined by their facial attractiveness?,"This study sought to determine how esthetic appearance of babies may affect their motivational processing by the adults. Healthy men and women were administered two laboratory-based tasks: a) key pressing to change the viewing time of normal-looking babies and of those with abnormal facial features (e.g., cleft palate, strabismus, skin disorders, Down's syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome) and b) attractiveness ratings of these images. Exposure to the babies' images produced two different response patterns: for normal babies, there was a similar effort by the two groups to extend the visual processing with lower attractiveness ratings by men; for abnormal babies, women exerted greater effort to shorten the viewing time despite attractiveness ratings comparable to the men.",These results indicate that gender differences in the motivational processing of babies include excessive (relative to the esthetic valuation) motivation to extend the viewing time of normal babies by men vs. shortening the exposure to the abnormal babies by women. Such gender-specific incentive sensitization phenomenon may reflect an evolutionary-derived need for diversion of limited resources to the nurturance of healthy offspring.,closed_qa
Locked plating of comminuted distal femur fractures: does unlocked screw placement affect stability and failure?,"Locked plates provide greater stiffness, possibly at the expense of fracture healing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate construct stiffness of distal femur plates as a function of unlocked screw position in cadaveric distal femur fractures. Osteoporotic cadaveric femurs were used. Four diaphyseal bridge plate constructs were created using 13-hole distal femur locking plates, all with identical condylar fixation. Constructs included all locked (AL), all unlocked (AUL), proximal unlocked (PUL), and distally unlocked (DUL) groups. Constructs underwent cyclic axial loading with increasing force per interval. Data were gathered on axial stiffness, torsional stiffness, maximum torque required for 5-degree external rotation, and axial force to failure. Twenty-one specimens were divided into AL, AUL, PUL, and DUL groups. Axial stiffness was not significantly different between the constructs. AL and PUL demonstrated greater torsional stiffness, maximum torque, and force to failure than AUL and AL showed greater final torsional stiffness and failure force than DUL (P<0.05). AL and PUL had similar axial, torsion, and failure measures, as did AUL and DUL constructs. All but 2 specimens fractured before medial gap closure during failure tests. Drop-offs on load-displacement curves confirmed all failures.",Only the screw nearest the gap had significant effect on torsional and failure stiffness but not axial stiffness. Construct mechanics depended on the type of screw placed in this position. This screw nearest the fracture dictates working length stiffness when the working length itself is constant and in turn determines overall construct stiffness in osteoporotic bone.,closed_qa
Do surgical trainees believe they are adequately trained to manage the ageing population?,"Increasing numbers of older patients are undergoing surgery. Older surgical patients are at a higher risk of perioperative complications and mortality. Multimorbidity, frailty, and physiological changes of ageing contribute to adverse outcomes. These complications are predominantly medical, rather than directly surgical. Guidelines recommend preoperative assessment of comorbidity, disability, and frailty in older patients undergoing surgery and closer perioperative collaboration between surgeons and geriatricians. We conducted a survey to assess knowledge and beliefs of surgical trainees toward common perioperative problems encountered in older surgical patients. Paper-based survey. Unselected UK surgical training-grade physicians (CT1-ST8) attending the 2013 Congress of The Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, Glasgow, UK, May 1-3, 2013. A total of 160 eligible UK surgical trainees attending the conference were invited to participate in the survey. Of them, 157 participated. Of the trainees, 68% (n = 107) reported inadequate training and 89.2% (n = 140) supported the inclusion of geriatric medicine issues in surgical curricula. Of the respondents, 77.2% (n = 122) were unable to correctly identify the key features required to demonstrate mental capacity, and only 3 of 157 respondents were familiar with the diagnostic criteria for delirium. Support from geriatric medicine was deemed necessary (84.7%, n = 133) but often inadequate (68.2%, n = 107). Surgical trainees support closer collaboration with geriatric medicine and shared care of complex, older patients (93.6%, n = 147).","UK surgical trainees believe that they receive inadequate training in the perioperative management of complex, older surgical patients and are inadequately supported by geriatric medicine physicians. In this survey sample, trainee knowledge of geriatric issues such as delirium and mental capacity was poor. Surgical trainees support the concept of closer liaison and shared care of complex, older patients with geriatric medicine physicians. Changes to surgical training and service development are needed.",closed_qa
Is surgery necessary for patients with hepatic angiomyolipoma?,"Hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare, hepatic mesenchymal neoplasm. Its preoperative diagnosis is very difficult, and the treatment is still controversial. The aim is to summarize experience in diagnosis and management of hepatic AML from a cancer center. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical presentation, histopathological, features and treatment of the tumors encountered at our institute from January 2000 to December 2012. The patients included six females and two males, with female preponderance. Six patients are asymptomatic. Laboratory tests lack specificity. Combining imaging modality, only one patient obtained the accurate diagnosis of hepatic AML and was confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy combined with homatropine methylbromide-45 staining. All other patients received hepatic resection. There was no tumor recurrence or increase of tumor size within the follow-up period.",We suggest fine-needle aspiration combined with homatropine methylbromide-45 staining should be performed in all patients who are asymptomatic and without serological abnormalities. Surgical resection might be considered only if the malignant potential of the lesion cannot be ruled out or the tumor size is increasing during observation.,closed_qa
Can therapeutic drug monitoring optimize exposure to piperacillin in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies?,"The objectives of this study were to describe piperacillin exposure in febrile neutropenia patients and determine whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be used to increase the achievement of pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) targets. In a prospective randomized controlled study (Australian New Zealand Registry, ACTRN12615000086561), patients were subjected to TDM for 3 consecutive days. Dose was adjusted in the intervention group to achieve a free drug concentration above the MIC for 100% of the dose interval (100% fT>MIC), which was also the primary outcome measure. The secondary PK/PD target was 50% fT>MIC. Duration of fever and days to recovery from neutropenia were recorded. Thirty-two patients were enrolled. Initially, patients received 4.5 g of piperacillin/tazobactam every 8 h or every 6 h along with gentamicin co-therapy in 30/32 (94%) patients. At the first TDM, 7/32 (22%) patients achieved 100% fT>MIC and 12/32 (38%) patients achieved 50% fT>MIC. Following dose adjustment, 11/16 (69%) of intervention patients versus 3/16 (19%) of control patients (P = 0.012) attained 100% fT>MIC, and 15/16 (94%) of intervention patients versus 5/16 (31%) of control patients (P = 0.001) achieved 50% fT>MIC. After the third TDM, the proportion of patients attaining 100% fT>MIC improved from a baseline 3/16 (19%) to 11/15 (73%) in the intervention group, while it declined from 4/16 (25%) to 1/15 (7%) in the control group. No difference was noted in the duration of fever and days to recovery from neutropenia.",Conventional doses of piperacillin/tazobactam may not offer adequate piperacillin exposure in febrile neutropenic patients. TDM provides useful feedback of dosing adequacy to guide dose optimization.,closed_qa
Does detection of fall using accelerometers and mobile phone technology?,"to study the sensitivity and specificity of fall detection using mobile phone technology. an experimental investigation using motion signals detected by the mobile phone. the research was conducted in a laboratory setting, and 18 healthy adults (12 males and 6 females; age = 29 ± 8.7 years) were recruited. each participant was requested to perform three trials of four different types of simulated falls (forwards, backwards, lateral left and lateral right) and eight other everyday activities (sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, level walking, walking up- and downstairs, answering the phone, picking up an object and getting up from supine). Acceleration was measured using two devices, a mobile phone and an independent accelerometer attached to the waist of the participants. Bland-Altman analysis shows a higher degree of agreement between the data recorded by the two devices. Using individual upper and lower detection thresholds, the specificity and sensitivity for mobile phone were 0.81 and 0.77, respectively, and for external accelerometer they were 0.82 and 0.96, respectively.","fall detection using a mobile phone is a feasible and highly attractive technology for older adults, especially those living alone. It may be best achieved with an accelerometer attached to the waist, which transmits signals wirelessly to a phone.",closed_qa
Is a patient controller for Parkinson's disease patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation reasonable?,"A patient controller (PC) is an optional device for patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) to have limited control of their stimulator system. We investigated the impact of a PC on DBS safety, most notably the handling/prevention of unexpected DBS failure in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients with subthalamic DBS were educated in the use of a PC. After a first impulse generator (IPG) replacement, data on the use of the PC were obtained from the patients' records and by a patient questionnaire. A total of 27 patients with IPG replacements after 4.4 ± 0.8 years (118.8 patient-years) were included. Thirteen patients transiently used the PC to optimize stimulation amplitudes. Eighteen patients reported events when they used the PC to ensure DBS being on. No accidental switch off by environmental electromagnetism was confirmed. In contrast, 4 patients accidentally turned the IPG off with the PC. Sixteen patients regularly checked the IPG battery but only 1 patient noted a low battery status before quarterly control visits. Of the 27 patients, 26 had anticipated and only 1 an unanticipated IPG replacement.","A PC is not needed for patient safety. However, in some patients, a PC is helpful to optimize stimulation amplitudes and to increase the patients' own perception of safety.",closed_qa
Do comparison of laser speckle contrast imaging with laser Doppler for assessing microvascular function?,"To compare the inter-day reproducibility of post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH) and sympathetic vasomotor reflexes assessed by single-point laser Doppler flowmetry (SP-LDF), integrating-probe LDF (IP-LDF) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), and the spatial variability of PORH assessed by IP-LDF and LSCI. We also evaluated the relationship between IP-LDF and LSCI perfusion values across a broad range of skin blood flows. Eighteen healthy adults (50% male, age 27 ± 4 years) participated in this study. Using SP-LDF, IP-LDF and LSCI, indices of skin blood flow were measured on the forearm during PORH (1-, 5- and 10-min occlusions) and on the finger pad during inspiratory gasp and cold pressor tests. These tests were repeated 3-7 days later. Data were converted to cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; laser Doppler flow/mean arterial pressure) and expressed as absolute and relative changes from pre-stimulus CVC (ΔCVC(ABS) and ΔCVC(REL), respectively), as well as normalised to peak CVC for the PORH tests. Reproducibility was expressed as within-subjects coefficients of variation (CV, in %) and intraclass correlation coefficients. The reproducibility of PORH on the forearm was poorer when assessed with SP-LDF and IP-LDF compared to LSCI (e.g., CV for 5-min PORH ΔCVC(ABS)=35%, 27% and 19%, respectively), with no superior method of data expression. In contrast, the reproducibility of the inspiratory gasp and cold pressor test responses on the finger pad were better with SP-LDF and IP-LDF compared to LSCI (e.g., CV for inspiratory gasp ΔCVC(REL)=13%, 7% and 19%, respectively). The spatial variability of PORH responses was poorer with IP-LDF compared to LSCI (e.g., CV ranging 11-35% versus 3-16%, respectively). The association between simultaneous LSCI and IP-LDF perfusion values was non-linear.","The reproducibility of cutaneous PORH was better when assessed with LSCI compared to SP-LDF and IP-LDF; probably due to measuring larger skin areas (lower inter-site variability). However, when measuring sympathetic vasomotor reflexes on the finger pad, reproducibility was better with SP-LDF and IP-LDF, perhaps due to the high sensitivity of LSCI to changes in skin blood flow at low levels.",closed_qa
Do biofilm reduction by a new burn gel that targets nociception?,"To compare the ability of an amorphous first aid topical gel containing vinegar, citric acid and EDTA (RescuDerm(TM); RESC) and various derivative formulations to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSEUD) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (STAPH) biofilms. 24-h biofilms prepared using the Minimum Biofilm Elimination Concentration (MBEC) Assay System were exposed for 4 or 24 h to the different gel formulations. Citric acid-free, acetic acid-free or acetic acid-free/sodium acetate-supplemented RESC gels reduced PSEUD and STAPH biofilm formation as effectively as RESC. Substituting the weak organic acids with equivalent concentrations of glacial acetic acid reduced the effectiveness of gel against PSEUD and STAPH biofilms by half, but viable bacterial counts still remained below 4 log(10) CFU/peg. Removal of gelling agent and/or EDTA enhanced efficacy against PSEUD but not STAPH biofilms. An acidified placebo gel formulation generated an only marginal bactericidal effect compared to that of RESC.","RESC is a promising new antimicrobial agent. Its weak organic acid content, rather than merely acidic pH, mediates its considerable in vitro bactericidal efficacy against bacterial biofilms.",closed_qa
Do akt activation and localisation correlate with tumour invasion and oncogene expression in thyroid cancer?,"Akt activation is involved in the pathogenesis of inherited thyroid cancer in Cowden's syndrome and in sporadic thyroid cancers. In cell culture, Akt regulates thyroid cell growth and survival; but recent data suggest that Akt also regulates cell motility in non-thyroid cell lines. We therefore sought to evaluate the role of Akt in thyroid cancer progression. We evaluated 46 thyroid cancer, 20 thyroid follicular adenoma, and adjacent normal tissues samples by immunohistochemistry for activated Akt (pAkt), Akt 1, 2, and 3, and p27 expression. Immunoblots were performed in 14 samples. Akt activation was identified in 10/10 follicular cancers, 26/26 papillary cancers, and 2/10 follicular variant of papillary cancers, but in only 4/66 normal tissue samples and 2/10 typical benign follicular adenomas. Immunoactive pAkt was greatest in regions of capsular invasion; and was localised to the nucleus in follicular cancers and the cytoplasm in papillary cancers, except for invasive regions of papillary cancers where it localised to both compartments. Immunoactive Akt 1, but not Akt 2 or Akt 3, correlated with pAkt localisation, and nuclear pAkt was associated with cytoplasmic expression of p27. In vitro studies using human thyroid cancer cells demonstrated that nuclear translocation of Akt 1 and pAkt were associated with cytoplasmic p27 and cell invasion and migration. Cell migration and the localisation of Akt 1, pAkt, and p27 were inhibited by PI3 kinase, but not MEK inhibition.",These data suggest an important role for nuclear activation of Akt 1 in thyroid cancer progression.,closed_qa
Does luteolin ameliorate cardiac failure in type I diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"The study aimed to determine whether luteolin can confer cardioprotective effects against diabetic cardiomyopathy in relation to specific and quantitative markers of oxidative stress. We examined diabetic cardiomyopathy by left ventricular hemodynamic analysis. Myocardial oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). Hypolipidaemic effects of luteolin were also investigated in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Myocardial Akt/PKB phosphorylation, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) protein levels were measured by Western blot in all rats at the end of the study. This study showed a significant increase in serum triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC), lower density lipoprotein (LDL), MDA content, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myocardial CTGF and a significant decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL), SOD and Akt phosphorylation level in the diabetic group compared to the control group. Luteolin treatment induced a significant decrease in serum TG, TC, LDL, MDA, CK, LDH, and myocardial CTGF and a significant increase in HDL, SOD and Akt phosphorylation levels in comparison with the diabetic group.",These results show that luteolin protects against the progression of diabetes mellitus-induced cardiac dysfunction by attenuation of myocardial oxidative stress probably through its antioxidant properties.,closed_qa
"Are age , hypertension , and lacunar stroke the major determinants of the severity of age-related white matter changes . The LADIS ( Leukoaraiosis and Disability in the Elderly ) Study?","Age-related white matter changes (ARWMC), seen on neuroimaging with high frequency in older people, are thought to be consequent to the effect of vascular risk factors and vascular diseases including hypertension and stroke. Among the proofs conventionally required for a factor to be considered a risk factor for a definite pathology, there is the demonstration of a trend in risk exposure related to disease severity. We sought whether such a trend existed in the association of vascular risk factors or comorbidities with the severity of ARWMC aiming particularly at further elucidating the relative roles of hypertension and stroke in this regard. The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability) Study is evaluating the role of ARWMC as an independent determinant of the transition to disability in the elderly. Six hundred and thirty-nine nondisabled subjects (mean age 74.1+/-5.0, M/F: 288/351) with ARWMC of different severity grades on MRI (mild, moderate, or severe according to the Fazekas scale) were assessed at baseline for demographics, vascular risk factors, and comorbidities, and are being followed up for 3 years. Age, frequency of hypertension and history of stroke increased along with increasing ARWMC severity independently of other factors. For hypertension, however, this occurred only in subjects without a stroke history, while for stroke history, it mainly depended on lacunar stroke. The amount of cigarettes smoked and the interaction between hypercholesterolemia and smoking predicted only the most severe ARWMC grade.","The LADIS Study confirms that age, hypertension and lacunar strokes are the major determinants of ARWMC. Smoking and hypercholesterolemia provide additional risk.",closed_qa
Is the thermal work limit a simple reliable heat index for the protection of workers in thermally stressful environments?,"Workers in many industries are exposed to thermally stressful work environments. Protection of the health of workers without unnecessarily compromising productivity requires the adoption of a heat index that is both reliable and easy to use. To evaluate the Thermal Work Limit (TWL), in a controlled environment and under field conditions, against these criteria. Volunteers performed graded work in a controlled thermal environment to determine the limiting workload for the conditions. Core temperature and heart rate were monitored as indicators of thermoregulation. In the field study, outdoor workers were monitored for signs of physiological strain in thermal environments which were characterized using both the traditional Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) and the TWL. Abilities of each of these indices to accurately reflect the thermal stress on workers were evaluated. In the controlled environment, the TWL was found to reliably predict the limiting workload. In the field study, TWL was a more appropriate and realistic index than WBGT, which was found to be excessively conservative.","The results confirm previously published studies evaluating TWL in underground environments, which have led to its widespread adoption in the Australian mining industry. The study extends the applicability of TWL to outdoor environments and generates management guidelines for its implementation.",closed_qa
Does quercetine attenuate the gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in a rat model?,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective role of quercetin in gentamicin-induced ototoxicity through an auditory brainstem response (ABR) test and a histopathological evaluation of the cochlea. In this study, 48 female adult Sprague-Dawley rats aged 20-22 weeks and weighing 200-250g were used. An ABR test was carried out on all rats prior to drug administration, after which, the rats were divided into four groups of 12 animals each. Drug administration was gentamicin 120mg/kg plus ethanol in group one; gentamicin 120mg/kg plus quercetin 15mg/kg in group two; quercetin 15mg/kg in group three; and ethanol in group four. The drugs were administered intraperitoneally once a day for two weeks, and the ABR test was repeated after drug administration. Subsequently, the rats were sacrificed and their cochleae were dissected and examined histopathologically. There was no significant difference between the pre-treatment ABR measurement values of the groups. However, a significant increase was detected in the ABR values in the group of rats that were administered gentamicin plus ethanol, while no statistically significant increase was found in the ABR values in the groups administered with gentamicin plus quercetin; quercetin alone; and ethanol alone. The number of TUNEL positive cells in the inner and outer hair cells in the Corti organ was found to be fewer, and Caspase 3 and 9 expressions were found to be weaker in the group receiving gentamicin plus quercetin than in the group receiving gentamicin plus ethanol.","Auditory function was detected to be significantly protected and apoptotic cells were found to be decreased when quercetin was administered together with gentamicin. From these results it was concluded that quercetin, a powerful antioxidant, attenuates ABR thresholds and histopathological lesions in the cochlea in gentamicin-induced ototoxicity in rats.",closed_qa
Trends in opioid agonist therapy in the Veterans Health Administration: is supply keeping up with demand?,"Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) through addiction specialty clinic settings (clinic-based OAT) using methadone or buprenorphine or office-based settings using buprenorphine (office-based OAT) is an evidence-based treatment for opioid dependence. The low number of clinic-based OATs available to veterans (N = 53) presents a barrier to OAT access; thus, the expansion in office-based OAT has been encouraged. To examine trends in office-based OAT utilization over time and whether availability of office-based OAT improved the proportion of veterans with opioid use disorders treated with OAT. We examined Veterans Health Administration (VHA) administrative data for evidence of buprenorphine prescribing and clinic-based OAT clinic stops from October 2003 through September 2010 [fiscal years (FY) 2004-2010]. The number of patients receiving buprenorphine increased from 300 at 27 facilities in FY2004 to 6147 at 118 facilities in FY2010. During this time, the number of patients diagnosed with an opioid use disorder increased by 45%; however, the proportion of opioid use disorder patients receiving OAT remained relatively stable, ranging from 25% to 27%.","Office-based OAT utilization and the number of opioid use disorder veterans treated with OAT are increasing at the same rate over time, suggesting that office-based OAT is being used to meet the growing need for OAT care. Although office-based OAT is increasingly being used within the VHA and may be one way the VHA is keeping up with the demand for OAT, more research is needed to understand how to engage a greater proportion of opioid use disorder patients in treatment.",closed_qa
Do childhood social circumstances affect overweight and obesity in early adulthood?,"The aim of the study was to examine the association of childhood circumstances with overweight and obesity in early adulthood, to analyse whether the respondent's education and current circumstances mediate these associations, and to explore whether the respondent's health behaviour affects these associations. This was a cross-sectional study with retrospective inquiries. The study was based on a representative two-stage cluster sample (N= 1894, participation rate 79%) of young adults aged 18-29 years in Finland in 2000. The outcome measure was three-class body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, overweight, and obesity). Multinomial logistic regression was used as the main statistical tool. In women, childhood circumstances (low parental education (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 2.43), parental unemployment (RRR= 2.09) and single-parent family (RRR= 1.99)) increased the risk of overweight (25<or = BMI<30), but the effects were largely attenuated by other childhood factors and early adult circumstances. In men, no significant childhood predictors of overweight were found. Single-parent family (RRR=2.32), parental alcohol problem (RRR= 2.71), parental mental health problems (RRR=2.28) and being bullied at school (RRR=3.13) predicted obesity (BMI>or = 30) in women in the age-adjusted models, and being bullied at school remained a significant predictor after adjusting for all childhood and current determinants. In both genders, the strong association between parental education and obesity remained significant after adjusting for all other determinants (for the lowest educational category, RRR= 3.56 in women, and RRR= 6.55 in men).","Childhood factors predict overweight and obesity in early adulthood. This effect is stronger on obesity than on overweight and in women than in men, and it seems to be partly mediated by adult circumstances. The results emphasize the lasting effect of childhood socioeconomic position on adult obesity. When preventive policies are being planned, social circumstances in childhood should be addressed.",closed_qa
Disturbances of grip force behaviour in focal hand dystonia: evidence for a generalised impairment of sensory-motor integration?,"Focal task specific dystonia occurs preferentially during performance of a specific task. There may be an inefficiently high grip force when doing manipulative tasks other than the trigger task, possibly reflecting a generalised impairment of sensory-motor integration. To examine how well subjects with writer's cramp (n = 4) or musician's cramp (n = 5) adapted their grip force when lifting a new object or catching a weight. Nine patients with focal hand dystonia and 10 controls were studied. Experiments addressed different motor behaviours: (A) lifting and holding an object; (B) adjusting grip force in anticipation of or in reaction to a change in load force by catching a small weight dropped expectedly or unexpectedly into a hand held receptacle. In (A), patients produced a grip force overshoot during the initial lifts; force overflow was most pronounced in those with writer's cramp. Patients and controls adjusted their grip force to object weight within one or two lifts, though patients settled to a steady force level above normal. In (B), patients with focal hand dystonia and normal controls showed similar predictive grip force adjustments to expected changes in object load, suggesting that this aspect of sensory-motor integration was normal. Patients had a shorter latency of grip force response than controls after an unexpected load increase, reflecting either a greater level of preparatory motor activity or a disinhibited spinal reflex response.",The overall increased grip force in patients with focal hand dystonia is likely to be a prelearned phenomenon rather than a primary disorder of sensory-motor integration.,closed_qa
High hepatitis C incidence in new injecting drug users: a policy failure?,"Evidence of ongoing hepatitis C (HCV) transmission among injecting drug users (IDUs) suggests a need for a better understanding of seroconversion characteristics among new IDUs and other vulnerable subgroups. This study aimed to determine incidence of HCV and associated risk factors among new IDUs in Sydney. IDUs who had injected drugs in the past six months and who were unaware of their antibody HCV status or knew their serostatus to be negative were recruited through street-based outreach, methadone clinics and needle and syringe programs in south-western Sydney. Anti-HCV negative IDUs (n = 215) were enrolled and followed-up at 3-6 monthly intervals. New IDUs (n = 204) were defined as aged below 30 years or injecting for<or = 6 years at baseline. A total of 61 seroconversions were observed and incidence was 45.8 per 100 person years. Independent predictors of seroconversion were duration of injecting<1 year (IRR = 3.10; 95% CI 1.47-6.54), female gender (IRR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.16-3.45), culturally and linguistically diverse background (CALDB) (IRR = 2.03; 95% CI 1.06-3.89) and intravenous cocaine use (IRR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.26-4.44).

Is initiation of glucose-based peritoneal dialysis associated with increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in non-diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease?,"Glucose-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the original PD form. However, glucose uptake from the peritoneal cavity may contribute to dysmetabolism. We retrospectively assessed metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components in 195 non-diabetic incident PD patients at baseline and after 34.3 (20.5-60.0) months of PD. MS was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. While 22.1% of the patients met MS criteria at baseline, 69.2% (p < 0.01) exhibited MS during PD. MS burden increased significantly after PD (p < 0.01). The disorder BMI and lipids, and MS components number, correlated with peritoneal glucose exposure and PD duration (p < 0.05). In Cox analysis, age, BMI, triglyceride, C-reactive protein (CRP) and glucose exposure were all independently associated with MS development.","PD commencement in end-stage renal disease patients was associated with an increased MS prevalence. High glucose exposure and long PD duration were associated with MS existence, along with old age, high BMI, triglyceride and CRP.",closed_qa
Do cardiac procedures in lung transplant recipients increase mortality in selected patients?,"Associated comorbidities in potential lung transplant recipients may significantly impact operative morbidity and mortality. We undertook this review to specifically study whether patients who underwent associated cardiac procedures either before (as a prerequisite) or during their lung transplantation had different outcomes when compared with the overall cohort of lung transplant recipients. A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients who underwent lung transplantation at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio from January 1994 to June 2004. The records of these patients were analyzed for patient-days on the ventilator, hospital length of stay, operative morbidity and mortality, and long-term survival. The patients were then divided into two groups and compared: patients who had a cardiac intervention either prerequisite to or concurrent with their transplant (group C, n = 13) and patients who did not (group NC [no cardiac intervention], n = 120). Although the median length of stay was longer in group C when compared with group NC, the number of patient-days on the ventilator and the operative morbidity and mortality were similar for both groups. Likewise, overall long-term survival was not significantly different (Kaplan-Meier method, p = 0.70).",Patients who are otherwise deemed to be good candidates for lung transplantation but are found to have an associated cardiac condition that could adversely affect their candidacy may still be considered for transplantation in selected cases if the cardiac abnormality can be addressed either before or during transplantation.,closed_qa
Are polymorphisms in the maternal sex steroid pathway associated with behavior problems in male offspring?,"Slight perturbations in maternal sex steroid production and metabolism may interfere with normal fetal neurodevelopment. The balance of maternal estrogens and androgens may have direct fetal effects, may influence the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, or may alter local hormonal activity within the fetal brain. We investigated maternal functional polymorphisms of CYP17, CYP19, and CYP1B1, which control three major enzymatic steps in sex steroid biosynthesis and metabolism, in relation to childhood behaviors. The Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Study enrolled a multiethnic urban pregnancy cohort from 1998 to 2002 (n=404). DNA was obtained from maternal blood (n=149) and from neonatal cord blood (n=53). At each visit, mothers completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, a parent-reported questionnaire used to evaluate children for behavior problems. We focused on problem behaviors more commonly associated with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (Hyperactivity, Attention Problems, Externalizing Behaviors, Conduct Disorder, Poor Adaptability) to determine whether maternal genetic variants in sex steroid production and metabolism influence sexually dimorphic behaviors in offspring. The more active gene variants were significantly associated with Attention Problems and poorer Adaptive Skills in male compared with female offspring. The CYP19 variant allele was also significantly associated with worse scores for boys on the Hyperactivity, Externalizing Problems Composite, and Adaptive Skills Composite scales (P<0.05).",We observed maladaptive behaviors in the male offspring of mothers who carried functional polymorphisms in the sex steroid pathway. The strongest associations were in domains commonly affected in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.,closed_qa
Is colonoscopic screening necessary for patients with gastric adenoma or cancer?,"Since colorectal adenoma or cancer is commonly associated with gastric adenoma or cancer, early colorectal adenoma detection can affect the survival of gastric adenoma or cancer patients. The purpose here was to investigate the colorectal adenoma or cancer prevalence and evaluate the necessity for screening colonoscopy in gastric adenoma or cancer patients. From September 2005 through August 2010, 857 patients younger than 70 years who had gastric adenoma or cancer were enrolled. Healthy age- and sex-matched controls were selected from the general screening population. The prevalence and risk of colorectal adenoma or cancer were compared between the participants and the controls. Data from 416 patients in the gastric neoplasm group (123 with gastric adenoma and 293 with gastric cancer) and 416 healthy control group participants were included in the statistical analysis. The presence of gastric adenoma or cancer was an independent risk factor for colorectal neoplasm (OR = 1.348, 95 % CI = 1.001-1.815). Patients with diffuse type gastric cancer had a lower prevalence of colorectal adenoma or cancer than those with gastric adenoma or intestinal type cancer. In gastric cancer patients younger than 50 years, intestinal type histology was significantly associated with colorectal adenoma or cancer (OR = 3.838, 95 % CI = 1.077-13.677).","The colorectal adenoma or cancer risk was significantly increased in patients with gastric adenoma or cancer. Therefore, screening colonoscopy should be considered for gastric adenoma or cancer patients including young patients, in the case of intestinal type gastric cancer.",closed_qa
Is intraoperative conversion from off-pump to on-pump coronary artery bypass associated with increased 30-day hospital readmission?,"We evaluated the impact of intraoperative conversion from off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OPCAB) to conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CCB) on rates of postoperative 30-day hospital readmissions. Using data from the California CABG outcomes reporting program, postoperative 30-day hospital readmissions were compared among CCB, OPCAB, and intraoperative conversions from OPCAB to CCB (IOC) for isolated CABG operations. A multivariable logistic regression model with inverse propensity for OPCAB weighting was used to compute risk-adjusted readmission rates. General linear models were used to test the differences in propensity-weighted and risk-adjusted readmission rates among CCB, OPCAB, and IOC cases. Among 22,389 isolated CABGs, 5,125 (22.9%) were OPCAB; 595 (11.6%) OPCAB patients had intraoperative conversion from OPCAB to CCB (IOC). The patients who underwent IOC had a higher prevalence of preoperative heart failure, left main coronary artery disease, and 3 or greater diseased coronary vessels compared with OPCAB without conversion. The risk-adjusted readmission model (weighted for OPCAB propensity) showed OPCAB without conversion was not associated with any increase in readmission rates when compared with CCB (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]; 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.963 to 1.081) but OPCAB with IOC had a significant effect on readmission (AOR, 1.258; 95% CI, 1.122 to 1.411, p<0.0001). The OPCAB with IOC was also associated with a higher proportion of readmissions due to postoperative infection (19.1% vs 11.9% of readmissions for CCB).",Intraoperative conversions from OPCAB to CCB are associated with a higher rate of postoperative hospital readmission and infection.,closed_qa
Do constitutively active TRPC channels of adipocytes confer a mechanism for sensing dietary fatty acids and regulating adiponectin?,"Calcium entry is pivotal in the heart and blood vessels, but its significance and mechanisms in adipose tissue are largely unknown. An important factor produced by adipocytes is adiponectin, which confers myocardial protection, insulin-sensitization, and antiatherosclerotic effects. To investigate the relevance of calcium channels to adipocytes and the production of adiponectin. Microarray analysis led to identification of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)1 and TRPC5 as channel subunits that are induced when adipocytes mature. Both subunits were found in perivascular fat of patients with atherosclerosis. Intracellular calcium and patch-clamp measurements showed that adipocytes exhibit constitutively active calcium-permeable nonselective cationic channels that depend on TRPC1 and TRPC5. The activity could be enhanced by lanthanum or rosiglitazone, known stimulators of TRPC5 and TRPC5-containing channels. Screening identified lipid modulators of the channels that are relevant to adipose biology. Dietary ω-3 fatty acids (eg, α-linolenic acid) were inhibitory at concentrations that are achieved by ingestion. The adipocyte TRPC1/TRPC5-containing channel was functionally negative for the generation of adiponectin because channel blockade by antibodies, knock-down of TRPC1-TRPC5 in vitro, or conditional disruption of calcium permeability in TRPC5-incorporating channels in vivo increased the generation of adiponectin. The previously recognized capability of α-linolenic acid to stimulate the generation of adiponectin was lost when calcium permeability in the channels was disrupted.","The data suggest that TRPC1 and TRPC5 contribute a constitutively active heteromultimeric channel of adipocytes that negatively regulates adiponectin and through which ω-3 fatty acids enhance the anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin.",closed_qa
Is lens gap junctional coupling modulated by connexin identity and the locus of gene expression?,"To investigate the effects of reducing connexin (Cx) diversity in the lens when the amount of connexin protein is nearly constant. Lenses in which the Cx50 coding region was replaced by that of Cx46 (knockin [KI]), were compared with wild type (WT) and Cx50-knockout (KO) lenses. Gap junctional conductance (G(j)), and membrane conductance were evaluated by using frequency domain impedance of intact lenses. KO of Cx50 produced small depolarized lenses with central opacities. KI of Cx46 did not restore growth, but rescued resting voltage and eliminated opacities. In WT lenses, the average G(j) was approximately 1 S/cm(2) of cell-to-cell contact in the outer shell of differentiating fibers (DFs), whereas it was approximately half that value in the core of mature fibers (MFs). KO of Cx50 reduced G(j) in DF to 44% of normal, whereas KI of Cx46 restored G(j) to approximately 60% of normal. In addition, KI of Cx46 markedly increased G(j) in MFs. In WT lenses, all gap junction channels in DFs close when pH is reduced, whereas those in MFs are insensitive to pH. KO of Cx50 made both DF and MF channels pH insensitive, whereas KI of Cx46 restored pH sensitivity of all DF channels without altering MF pH insensitivity","Lens size and fiber cell coupling conductance depended on which connexin was expressed on the Cx50 gene locus, whereas homeostasis of central fibers and normal gap junction gating were maintained when either connexin was expressed. The authors conclude that the roles of lens gap junction channels depend not only on the primary sequence of the expressed connexin, but also on the gene locus that expresses the connexin.",closed_qa
Is lipodystrophy in HIV-1-positive patients associated with insulin resistance in multiple metabolic pathways?,"Treatment for HIV-1 infection is complicated by fat redistribution (lipodystrophy). This is associated with insulin resistance concerning glucose uptake. Our aim was to characterize glucose metabolism more comprehensively in HIV-1-infected patients with lipodystrophy. We assessed glucose disposal and its pathways, glucose production, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, and the degree to which these parameters could be suppressed by insulin. Six HIV-1-infected men on protease inhibitor-based HAART with lipodystrophy (HIV+LD) were studied. The results were compared with those in six matched healthy male volunteers. Insulin sensitivity was quantified by hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp. Glucose production and uptake were assessed by tracer dilution employing 6,6D(2)-glucose. At post-absorptive insulin concentrations, glucose production was 47% higher in HIV+LD than controls (P = 0.025). During clamp, glucose production was suppressed by 53% in HIV+LD, but by 85% in controls (P = 0.004). Glucose disposal increased in both groups, but by only 27% in HIV+LD versus 201% in controls (P = 0.004). Consequently, insulin-stimulated total glucose disposal was lower in HIV+LD patients (P = 0.006). Non-oxidative glucose disposal as percentage of total disposal did not differ significantly between groups (63% in HIV+LD and 62% in controls). Baseline plasma FFA concentrations were higher (0.60 versus 0.35 mmol/l; P = 0.024), whereas FFA decline during hyperinsulinemia was less (65 versus 85%; P = 0.01) in HIV+LD versus controls.","Post-absorptive glucose production is increased in HIV-1-infected patients with lipodystrophy. Moreover, both the ability of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production and lipolysis, and to stimulate peripheral glucose uptake and its metabolic pathways is reduced, indicating severe resistance concerning multiple effects of insulin.",closed_qa
Is renal cortical necrosis a disappearing entity in obstetric acute kidney injury in developing countries : our three decade of experience from India?,"Obstetrical complications are the commonest causes of Renal Cortical Necrosis (RCN). However, the overall incidence of RCN in obstetric acute kidney injury in developing countries has been decreasing in recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changing profile of RCN in obstetric AKI over the last three decades. This single center study included patients with biopsy proven renal cortical necrosis over a period of 32 years from 1982 to 2014. The diagnosis of RCN was suspected in patients with prolonged AKI (>4 weeks) with absolute anuria in the setting of hemorrhage, hypotension and sepsis; and was confirmed by renal biopsy. The changing pattern in the incidence, etiology and outcome of RCN in patients with obstetric AKI was compared in the three study periods, namely 1982-1991, 1992-2002 and 2003-2014. Over a period of 32 years, RCN was diagnosed in 15/259(5.8%) cases of obstetric AKI. Diffuse and patchy cortical necrosis were noted in 8(53.3%) and 7(46.7%) patients, respectively. RCN occurred in 17%(11/65), 2.4%(3/125) and 1.44%(1/69) patients in 1982-1991, 1992-2002 and 2003-2014, respectively. Septic abortion was commonest cause of RCN in the first two study periods but no case was observed in last decade. The decrease in incidence of RCN over the three decades was statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). Maternal mortality decreased to zero in 2003-2014 from 72.7% in 1982-1991.",The incidence of RCN in obstetric AKI in developing countries has declined low enough to label it as a disappearing entity.,closed_qa
Does bee venom suppress methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference in mice?,"Although acupuncture is most commonly used for its analgesic effect, it has also been used to treat various drug addictions including cocaine and morphine in humans. This study was designed to investigate the effect of bee venom injection on methamphetamine-induced addictive behaviors including conditioned place preference and hyperlocomotion in mice. Methamphetamine (1 mg/kg) was subcutaneously treated on days 1, 3 and 5 and the acquisition of addictive behaviors was assessed on day 7. After confirming extinction of addictive behaviors on day 17, addictive behaviors reinstated by priming dose of methamphetamine (0.1 mg/kg) was evaluated on day 18. Bee venom (20 microl of 1 mg/ml in saline) was injected to the acupuncture point ST36 on days 1, 3 and 5. Repeated bee venom injections completely blocked development of methamphetamine-induced acquisition and subsequent reinstatement. Single bee venom acupuncture 30 minutes before acquisition and reinstatement test completely inhibited methamphetamine-induced acquisition and reinstatement. Repeated bee venom acupunctures from day 8 to day 12 after methamphetamine-induced acquisition partially but significantly suppressed reinstatement.",These findings suggest that bee venom acupuncture has a preventive and therapeutic effect on methamphetamine-induced addiction.,closed_qa
Is infertility in cryptorchidism linked to the stage of germ cell development at orchidopexy?,"Cryptorchidism represents the most common endocrine disease in boys, with infertility frequently observed in unilateral as well as bilateral forms. In this study, we examined the role of Ad (dark) spermatogonia for fertility in cryptorchid boys. The hypothesis to be proven was that boys lacking Ad spermatogonia will develop infertility despite a successful orchidopexy at an early age. To estimate total sperm count, one of the most predictive parameters of male fertility, we analyzed the ejaculatein 218 cryptorchid men and correlated it with the developmental stage of their germ cells at the time of successful surgery. Abnormal sperm concentration (<40 x 10(6)/ejaculate) was found in half of the patients under the study. 47.5% of unilateral and 78% of bilateral cryptorchid males had their sperm concentration in the infertility range according to the WHO standards. If transformation into Ad spermatogonia had occurred, age-related differences in the fertility outcome was observed. The younger the unilateral cryptorchid boys were at surgery, the higher their sperm count. Age-related difference was not found in the group of cryptorchid men having had no A dark spermatogonia at time of surgery, indicating that in this group a successful orchidopexy is insufficient to prevent infertility development and, in particular, the development of azoospermia.",The presence of Ad spermatogonia at surgery is an excellent prognostic parameter for future fertility. Cryptorchid boys lacking these cells will develop infertility despite successful orchidopexy at an early age.,closed_qa
Are one-stop shops acceptable?,"Traditionally, genitourinary medicine (GUM) and contraceptive services have been provided separately. Providing these services on one site, as a one-stop shop, has been suggested as a way of improving access to care. There is little evidence about the acceptability of such an approach. We aimed to assess acceptability of different one-stop shop models (a young people's, an all ages (mainstream) and a general practice service) of sexual health provision among different community groups. Between April and December 2005, 19 semi-structured interviews and 14 focus groups were conducted with young heterosexual men (n = 48), men who have sex with men (MSM; n = 46) and minority ethnic men and women (n = 28) across England. Knowledge of one-stop shops was limited. The concept was acceptable to participants (except MSM), although there was variation as to the preferred model. Young men and African individuals described distrust of general practice confidentiality, preferring young people's or mainstream models, respectively. South Asians associated stigma with GUM, preferring instead a general practice one-stop shop. Regardless of model, respondents expressed preference for one provider/one session to provide GUM and contraceptive care.","In terms of acceptability there can be no blue print one-stop shop model. Local assessments should determine whether a one-stop shop would have public health benefit and if so how best one should be set up to maximise access. To accommodate client preference for one provider/session for their sexual health needs it may be that the development of ""integrated training"" for providers across clinical specialties is a more realistic way forward.",closed_qa
Does prevalence and correlate of intimate partner violence against HIV-seropositive pregnant women in a Nigerian population?,"To evaluate the prevalence and correlates of intimate partner violence among HIV-positive pregnant Nigerian women. Cross-sectional study using an anonymous semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. The antenatal clinic at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, from June 2008 to December 2009. 305 HIV-positive women receiving antenatal care. An anonymous semi-structured World Health Organization modified questionnaire that elicited information on the experiences of intimate partner violence, was administered to the women by trained female interviewers. Prevalence, pattern and risk factors associated with experiencing intimate partner violence. The prevalence of intimate partner violence among the women was 32.5%, with psychological violence being the most common form of violence reported (27.5%) and physical violence the least reported (5.9%). Identified risk factors for experiencing violence were multiparity (Odds ratio 9.4; CI 1.23-71.33), respondents with an HIV-positive child (Odds ratio 9.2; CI 4.53-18.84), experience of violence before they were diagnosed HIV-positive (Odds ratio 44.4; 10.33-190.42) and women with partners without post-secondary education (Odds ratio 2.3; CI 1.40-3.91).","Intimate partner violence is a prevalent public health problem among HIV-infected pregnant women in our community and it may hinder efforts to scale up prevention of mother-child transmission programs, especially in developing countries. Screening for intimate partner violence to identify abused women should be incorporated into these programs to offer these women optimal care.",closed_qa
Does microcolony imaging of Aspergillus fumigatus treated with echinocandins reveal both fungistatic and fungicidal activities?,"The echinocandins are lipopeptides that can be employed as antifungal drugs that inhibit the synthesis of 1,3-β-glucans within the fungal cell wall. Anidulafungin and caspofungin are echinocandins used in the treatment of Candida infections and have activity against other fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus. The echinocandins are generally considered fungistatic against Aspergillus species. Culture of A. fumigatus from conidia to microcolonies on a support of porous aluminium oxide (PAO), combined with fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, was used to investigate the effects of anidulafungin and caspofungin. The PAO was an effective matrix for conidial germination and microcolony growth. Additionally, PAO supports could be moved between agar plates containing different concentrations of echinocandins to change dosage and to investigate the recovery of fungal microcolonies from these drugs. Culture on PAO combined with microscopy and image analysis permits quantitative studies on microcolony growth with the flexibility of adding or removing antifungal agents, dyes, fixatives or osmotic stresses during growth with minimal disturbance of fungal microcolonies.","Anidulafungin and caspofungin reduced but did not halt growth at the microcony level; additionally both drugs killed individual cells, particularly at concentrations around the MIC. Intact but not lysed cells showed rapid recovery when the drugs were removed. The classification of these drugs as either fungistatic or fungicidal is simplistic. Microcolony analysis on PAO appears to be a valuable tool to investigate the action of antifungal agents.",closed_qa
Do isoflavones and gamma irradiation inhibit cell growth in human salivary gland cells?,"We studied the effects of isoflavones and irradiation on cell cycle in a human salivary gland cell line (HSG). Genistein and a soy isoflavone conjugate (NS) inhibited DNA synthesis. Cells deconjugated the glucoside form of isoflavones in NS to the aglycones genistein and daidzein. NS, genistein and IR increased phosphorylation of p53 and p21 CIP1 at serine 15 (phos-p53). Irradiation and NS also increased levels of p21 CIP1.

Do papanicolaou smears induce partial immunity against sexually transmitted viral infections?,"In a case-control study of hormonal contraceptives and invasive cervical cancer, an unexpected finding was a substantial decline in the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection according to the lifetime number of Pap smears received. Here we assess the risk of 3 sexually transmitted viral infections -- herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2), HPV, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2 -- in relation to the lifetime receipt of Pap smears. Stored sera taken from 1540 controls were tested for HSV2 and HIV; cervical scrapings were tested for HPV. Confounder-adjusted odds ratios for the lifetime receipt of Pap smears were estimated, relative to never having had a Papanicolau test. For ever-receipt of a Papanicolau test, the odds ratios for HSV2 and HPV were 0.7 (95% confidence interval = 0.5-0.9) and 0.5 (0.3-0.7), respectively, and there were dose-response trends according to the lifetime number of Pap smears received (test for trend P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). For HSV2 the odds ratios according to last receipt declined from 0.8 for 10 or more years previously to 0.4 for <1 year previously (trend P = 0.002). For HPV the ORs were 0.4 (0.3-0.7) for last receipt 5-9 years previously and 0.5 (0.4-0.8) for less than 5 years previously; for HIV the odds ratio for last receipt less than 5 years previously was 0.4 (0.3-0.9). For HSV2 and HIV the crude odds ratio estimates were systematically lower than the adjusted estimates, and residual confounding cannot be ruled out. In particular, the true number of sexual partners may have been under-reported, and there was no information on the sexual activity of the male partners, or on other health behaviors of the women or their partners.",We hypothesize that Pap smears may provoke a short-term immune response against sexually transmitted viral infections.,closed_qa
Does quality improvement intervention reduce episodes of long-term acute care hospital central line-associated infections?,"Reducing central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) poses a set of unique challenges in long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHS). Patients are often admitted to LTACHs with central lines in place from the previous hospitalization; thus, LTACHs lack control over insertion techniques and respective central line care and maintenance. This study aimed to demonstrate the impact of a methodical bathing approach with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) cloths and a correlation with a reduced prevalence of CLABSIs in our LTACH population. This retrospective observational quality initiative conducted in a 105-bed LTACH used plan-do-study-act methodology to assess the effects of a revised bathing approach using 2% CHG. Statistical significance demonstrated a 65% reduction in CLABSI on the pilot unit after the 6-month initial trial.

Does endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging identify locally advanced prostate cancer in select patients with clinically localized disease?,"Endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging (erMRI) has been reported to improve the prediction of pathologic Stage T3 disease in patients with clinical Stage T1,2 disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 10 to 20 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score of 7 or less, and at least 50% of the biopsy specimens positive from a sextant sampling. This study examines the performance characteristics of the erMRI to predict established extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and PSA failure-free survival (bNED) in this subgroup. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy of the erMRI to predict established ECE and SVI were calculated in the proposed subgroup. PSA failure-free survival stratified by the erMRI-defined stage was estimated by using the method of Kaplan and Meier. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy to predict established ECE and SVI in clinical Stage T1,2 patients was 65%, 100%, 100%, 79%, and 84%, respectively. No patient would have been excluded from surgery on the basis of a false-positive study. Moreover, the percent of patients with pathologic organ-confined disease would have increased from 32% to 61%, and the 3-year bNED rate would have increased from 12% to 45% (P = 0.07) if only patients with erMRI Stage T2 disease were selected for surgery.",The erMRI may significantly improve the identification of established ECE and SVI in select patients with prostate cancer preoperatively.

Prazosin participants (n = 32) and placebo participants (n = 35) were analyzed separately. In prazosin participants, each 10-mm Hg higher baseline standing systolic BP increment resulted in an additional 14-point reduction (improvement) of Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total score at end point (p = .002). All other combinations of baseline BP parameters and PTSD outcome measures were similarly significant or demonstrated trends in the predicted direction.

Is collagen-induced p38 MAP kinase activation a biomarker of platelet hyper-aggregation in patients with diabetes mellitus?,"We developed a novel method for diagnosing platelet hyper-aggregation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). By measuring the dose response of platelet aggregation to collagen, an individual ED(50) was determined. Based on the normal range identified in non-DM controls (mean+/-two SEM=0.460+/-0.082 microg/ml, n=47), type 2 DM patients were divided into high ED(50) (ED(50)>0.542 microg/ml; n=32: group I) or low ED(50) groups (ED(50)<0.378 microg/ml; n=32; group II). In these patients, collagen-induced levels of phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-p44/p42 MAPK were measured using Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In group II, the collagen (0.3 and 1 microg/ml)-induced levels of both phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-p44/p42 MAPK measured by western blot analysis were found to be significantly higher than those in group I. The individual ED(50) was found to be significantly correlated with the collagen-induced levels of phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-p44/p42 MAPK. This correlation was also observed when ELISA was used to measure phospho-p38 MAPK levels in a different population of DM patients (n=90).",These results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation levels of collagen-induced p38 MAPK and p44/p42 MAPK represent the hyperaggregability of platelets and that the quantification of phospho-p38 MAPK can be a new and useful diagnostic biomarker of platelet hyper-aggregation in DM patients.,closed_qa
Does rhoE regulate actin cytoskeleton organization in human periodontal ligament cells under mechanical stress?,"RhoE and regulator of G-proteins signalling (RGS) 2 were identified as the up-regulated genes in human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells under compression. RhoE belongs to the Rho GTPase family, and RGS2, a novel family of GTPase-activating proteins, turns off the G-protein signalling. Rho family proteins have recently been known to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics in various cell types. In this study, we investigated the involvement of RhoE and RGS2 in the regulation of actin filament organization in the PDL cells under mechanical stress. Human PDL cells were cultured and subjected to a static compressive force (3.0g/cm(2)) for 48h. To observe changes in the actin cytoskeleton and the expression of RhoE and RGS2 in response to mechanical stress, immunofluorescence analysis was performed. To examine the role of RhoE and RGS2 in actin filament organization, cells were transfected with antisense S-oligonucleotides (ODNs) to RhoE and RGS2. Compressive force caused a loss and disassembly of actin stress fibres leading to cell spreading. Immunocytochemical study revealed that RhoE and RGS2 expressions were induced by mechanical stress and localized in the perinuclear and in the cell membrane, respectively. The impaired formation of stress fibres caused by compressive forces was recovered by treatment with antisense S-ODN to RhoE to the control levels. However, addition of antisense S-ODN to RGS2 did not affect the stress fibre formation.","These results indicate that the loss and disassembly of stress fibres due to mechanical stress are mediating RhoE signalling, without the exertion of RGS2.",closed_qa
Differential expression of the inflammation marker IL12p40 in the at-risk mental state for psychosis: a predictor of transition to psychotic disorder?,"The identification of biomarkers of transition from the at-risk mental state (ARMS) to psychotic disorder is important because early treatment of psychosis is associated with improved outcome. Increasing evidence points to an inflammatory contribution to psychosis. We questioned whether raised levels of plasma inflammatory markers predict transition from ARMS to psychotic disorder and whether any such predictors could be reduced by omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). We measured the levels of 40 neuroinflammation biomarkers using a commercially available immunoassay kit. Firstly, we compared inflammatory markers in subjects in the ARMS who transitioned to psychotic disorder (n = 11) compared to subjects who did not (n = 28). Then we compared inflammatory markers in all subjects before and after ω-3 PUFA treatment (n = 40). Our data provides preliminary evidence that elevations in the baseline plasma levels of the inflammatory marker IL12/IL23p40 are associated with transition from ARMS to psychotic disorder. IL12/IL23p40 levels did not change following 12 weeks administration of ω-3 PUFAs. These findings provide evidence that elevated plasma IL12/IL23p40 is a potential biomarker of increased risk for transition to psychotic disorder.",Further studies are required to confirm and extend this finding. Our results do not provide support for the possibility that administration of ω-3 PUFAs act to reduced transition to psychotic disorder by reducing blood levels of IL12/IL23p40.,closed_qa
Is nicotine dependence related to smokers' support for restrictions on smoking?,"To examine the relationship between nicotine dependence and attitudes, predicted behaviours and support regarding restrictions on smoking. Population-based, computer-assisted, telephone survey of adults in Ontario, Canada using a two-stage stratified sampling design; 1764 interviews were completed (65% response rate) yielding 424 (24%) cigarette smokers, of whom 354 (83%) smoked daily. The Heaviness of Smoking Index was used as a measure of nicotine dependence. Attitudes toward smoking restrictions, predicted compliance with more restrictions, and support for total smoking bans. Attitudes favorable to smoking restrictions tended to decrease with increased nicotine dependence, but the associations were not statistically significant after adjusting for demographic variables. Predicted compliance with more restrictions on smoking decreased with higher levels of dependence, as did support for a total ban on smoking in restaurants, workplaces, bingo halls, and hockey arenas. Support for smoking bans in food courts, family fast food restaurants, and bars and taverns did not vary significantly with level of nicotine dependence.",Level of nicotine dependence is associated with intended behaviors and support for smoking restrictions in some settings.

"Uric acid, cardiovascular events and renal dysfunction: a circumstantial connection?","We analyzed 163 patients consecutively admitted in the Intensive Cardiac Care Unit of the 1st Cardiology Clinic, County Hospital ""St. Spiridon"" Iasi. The cut-off value of serum uric acid was defined as 7 mg%. There were recorded anthropometric, anamnesis, clinical and paraclinical data. We compared the normal uricemia group (108 patients) with the hyperuricemia group (55 patients). The serum uric acid value was 5.22 +/- 1.16 mg% in the normouricemia group and 8.58 +/- 1.86 mg% in the hyperuricemia group. The statistically significant differences between the two groups relate to sex, smoking as cardiovascular risk factor, diastolic blood pressure and ejection fraction (lower in the hyperuricemia group were the dilated cardiomyopathy prevail). If the patients are grouped according to creatinine clearance less than or greater than 60 ml/min we found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of serum uric acid value (p<0.001), age (p<0.001), renal dysfunction and dyslipidaemia (p 0.001).","The analysis performed doesn't demonstrate the role of uric acid as independent risk factor in a group that includes patients with different heart diseases (dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease or hypertension).",closed_qa
Is autonomic symptom burden associated with MS-related fatigue and quality of life?,"Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness are common in multiple sclerosis (MS), even in patients with normal exams. Little is known about the relationship of autonomic dysfunction with these symptoms and quality of life. Assess the association of autonomic symptom burden with fatigue, clinical status and quality of life. Subjects completed an autonomic symptom (COMPASS-31), quality of life (MSQOL-54) and fatigue (FSS) questionnaire at their routine MS clinic follow-up. Demographic and clinical data were collected from the medical record. Pearson correlations were assessed between autonomic symptoms and fatigue, quality of life, disability and disease duration. One-hundred subjects completed the study (mean age 48 years; 78% female; 84% relapsing-remitting), mean disease duration was 14.7 years and mean EDSS 2.5. MSQOL-54 composite scores were 58 physical and 65 mental. COMPASS-31 correlated with MSQOL-54 (Physical R= -0.60; Mental -0.54; p<0.001) and FSS (R=0.51; p<0.001). There was no relationship between COMPASS-31 and EDSS (R=0, p=0.97) or disease duration (R= -0.02, p=0.84).",Autonomic symptom burden is correlated with decreased quality of life and increased fatigue. Autonomic symptoms are present early in the disease and at low disability and may reflect aspects of disease burden that are not well-captured by current disability measures.,closed_qa
Are all people with diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors or microvascular complications at very high risk?,"To verify whether it is possible, in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) considered at very high cardiovascular (CV) risk, stratify this risk better and identify significant modifiable risk factor (including lifestyle habits) to help patients and clinicians improve CV prevention. People with DM and microvascular diseases or one or more CV risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, poor dietary habits, overweight, physical inactivity) included in the Risk and Prevention study were selected. We considered the combined endpoint of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and stroke and CV death. A multivariate Cox proportional analysis was carried out to identify relevant predictors. We also used the RECPAM method to identify subgroups of patients at higher risk. In our study, the rate of major CV events was lower than expected (5 % in 5 years). Predictors of CV events were age, male, sex, heart failure, previous atherosclerotic disease, atrial fibrillation, insulin treatment, high HbA1c, heart rate and other CV diseases while being physically active was protective. RECPAM analysis indicated that history of atherosclerotic diseases and a low BMI defined worse prognosis (HR 4.51 95 % CI 3.04-6.69). Among subjects with no previous atherosclerotic disease, men with HbA1c more than 8 % were at higher CV risk (HR 2.77; 95 % CI 1.86-4.14) with respect to women.","In this population, the rate of major CV events was lower than expected. This prediction model could help clinicians identify people with DM at higher CV risk and support them in achieving goals of physical activity and HbA1c.",closed_qa
Does residual Tricuspid Regurgitation following Tricuspid Valve Repair during Concomitant Valve Surgery worsen Late Survival?,"Concomitant tricuspid valve repair (TVr) for functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) at the time of left-sided valve surgery has become increasingly more common over the past decade. The impact of residual post-repair TR on late outcomes remains unclear. All patients undergoing TVr during concomitant left-sided valve surgery at our institution from 2005-2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to the degree of post-cardiopulmonary bypass TR observed on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography; 0-1+ TR (No TR, n = 246) and ≥2+ TR (Residual TR, n = 26). Primary outcomes of interest were 30-day survival, 4-year survival, and follow-up TR grade. A propensity-matched subgroup analysis was performed in addition to the overall cohort analysis. Mean age for all patients was 70.3 ± 13.0 years and 107 (39%) patients were male. There was no difference in 30-day survival between groups (92% No TR versus 96% Residual TR, P = .70). Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall 4-year survival showed a trend toward worsened survival in the Residual TR group (log rank P = .17) and propensity-matched subgroup analysis showed significantly worse 4-year survival for Residual TR (log rank P = .02). At mean echocardiographic follow up of 11.9 ± 22.5 months, TR grade was significantly worse in the Residual TR group compared to No TR (1.5 ± 0.8 Residual TR versus 0.9 ± 0.9 No TR, P = .005), although TR severity was significantly improved from immediately post-bypass.",Patients left with residual TR following TVr during concomitant left-sided valve surgery have significantly decreased late survival compared to patients left with no post-repair TR.,closed_qa
Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) D subunit (SDHD) inactivation in a growth-hormone-producing pituitary tumor: a new association for SDH?,"Mutations in the subunits B, C, and D of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mitochondrial complex II have been associated with the development of paragangliomas (PGL), gastrointestinal stromal tumors, papillary thyroid and renal carcinoma (SDHB), and testicular seminoma (SDHD).AIM: Our aim was to examine the possible causative link between SDHD inactivation and somatotropinoma. A 37-yr-old male presented with acromegaly and hypertension. Other family members were found with PGL. Elevated plasma and urinary levels of catecholamines led to the identification of multiple PGL in the proband in the neck, thorax, and abdomen. Adrenalectomy was performed for bilateral pheochromocytomas (PHEO). A GH-secreting macroadenoma was also found and partially removed via transsphenoidal surgery (TTS). Genetic analysis revealed a novel SDHD mutation (c.298_301delACTC), leading to a frame shift and a premature stop codon at position 133 of the protein. Loss of heterozygosity for the SDHD genetic locus was shown in the GH-secreting adenoma. Down-regulation of SDHD protein in the GH-secreting adenoma by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry was found. A literature search identified other cases of multiple PGL and/or PHEO in association with pituitary tumors.","We describe the first kindred with a germline SDHD pathogenic mutation, inherited PGL, and acromegaly due to a GH-producing pituitary adenoma. SDHD loss of heterozygosity, down-regulation of protein in the GH-secreting adenoma, and decreased SDH enzymatic activity supports SDHD's involvement in the pituitary tumor formation in this patient. Older cases of multiple PGL and PHEO and pituitary tumors in the literature support a possible association between SDH defects and pituitary tumorigenesis.",closed_qa
Is the ICAM-1 469 T/C gene polymorphism but not 241 G/A associated with Behçets disease in the Lebanese population?,"To investigate the association of the 2 intracellular adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-1) gene polymorphisms [thymidine/cytidine (T/C) 469 and guanosine/adenosine (G/A) 241] in Behçets disease in Lebanon. We initiated the study in July 2003, and carried out the work in the research laboratory of Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon. We extracted the DNA by glass fiber matrix mini column. We amplified the ICAM gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and tested the PCR products for the presence of the polymorphisms using a restriction enzyme specific for each polymorphism. We analyzed the results by agarose electrophoresis. We demonstrated the association of only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (K469) with Behçets disease, while we could not detect the other SNP (G241A) in either controls or patients in the Lebanese population.","The ICAM-1 gene polymorphism 469 T/C, but not 241 G/A, may encode risk for Behçets disease in the Lebanese population.",closed_qa
Does interaction between monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells induce expression of hepatocyte growth factor?,"To investigate the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)--a multifunctional factor implicated in tissue regeneration, wound healing and angiogenesis--that is induced by cell-to-cell interactions between monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), using coculture of human VSMCs and cells of the human monocytoid cell line, THP-1. We collected supernatant from the coculture medium and measured HGF concentrations with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Northern blot analysis of HGF mRNA was performed using a specific cDNA. To explore which types of cells produce HGF, we performed immunohistochemistry. Coculture of VSMCs with THP-1 cells for 24 h caused a fivefold increase in HGF concentrations over that in control VSMC culture. Northern blot analysis showed an induction of HGF mRNA in the coculture with a peak at 3 h. Separated cocultures demonstrated that both direct contact and soluble factors contribute to the production of HGF. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that both types of cells in the coculture produce HGF. Neutralizing antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 inhibited the HGF production in THP-1 cells and VSMCs that was induced by the coculture conditioned medium. The protein kinase C inhibitors H-7, calphostin C and K252b, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, significantly inhibited the production of HGF in the coculture.","Cell-to-cell interactions between monocytes and VSMCs induced HGF synthesis in both types of cells, suggesting that local HGF production induced by this cell-to-cell interaction has an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, atherosclerosis or vascular remodelling.",closed_qa
Is peak aerobic power an important component of physical performance in older women?,"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between peak aerobic power (VO2peak) and performance on a modified Physical Performance Test (modified PPT) in older women. One hundred one women aged 75 years and older seeking enrollment in randomized, controlled trials of exercise and/or hormone replacement therapy were recruited from the community-at-large and from congregate living sites. Measures obtained included VO2peak, a modified PPT, and self-reports about performance of activities of daily living. Simple regression analysis demonstrated that VO2peak was associated with total PPT score (r =.53, p <.001), gait speed (r =.44, p <.001), time to arise from a chair five times (r =.43, p = <.001), and time to climb one flight of stairs (r =.36, p =.007). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the relationships between VO2peak and total modified PPT score, gait speed, chair rise time, and time to climb one flight of stairs were independent of age.",Peak aerobic power is a significant independent predictor of performance on a standardized test of physical function in older women and is an important component of physical frailty in this population.,closed_qa
Does chronic endothelin receptor blockade prevent renal vasoconstriction and sodium retention in rats with chronic heart failure?,"Importance of endothelin in mediating the chronic renal alterations of chronic heart failure was studied in rats chronically treated with bosentan after myocardial infarction. Rats were subjected to coronary artery ligation and were treated for 8 weeks with placebo or bosentan, a dual ET(A) and ET(B) receptor antagonist, (approximately 100 mg/kg/day) as food admix. Sham-operated rats served as normal controls. Cardiac and renal functions were measured at the end of 8-week treatment. Bosentan significantly reduced the elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (from 26.6+/-3.3 to 11.4+/-2.2 mmHg, P<0.001) and the increased heart-to-body-weight ratio seen in untreated rats with myocardial infarction. Bosentan prevented the marked increase in renal vascular resistance (bosentan, 7.7+/-0.6; untreated, 15.6+/-2.5 mmHg/ml/min; P<0.001). This led to a significant increase in renal plasma flow resulting in a decrease in filtration fraction. Bosentan furthermore increased urinary sodium excretion.","Prolonged ET receptor blockade in rats with myocardial infarction has chronic renal vasodilatory effect and improves renal sodium excretory function. Thus, dual ET antagonists such as bosentan might be useful in the treatment of the progressive renal failure associated with human chronic heart failure.",closed_qa
Does exercise pattern influence skeletal muscle hybrid fibers of runners and nonrunners?,"To determine whether relationships between skeletal muscle hybrid fiber composition and whole-body exercise patterns help to elucidate their transitional capacity or a fine-tuning response to functional demands. This study investigated hybrid fibers from vastus lateralis biopsies of runners (N= 13) and nonrunners (N = 9) and related hybrid fiber occurrence and distribution of myosin heavy-chain isoforms (MHC) within hybrid fibers to exercise patterns. MHC composition of single fibers was identified by SDS-PAGE. Runners had more fibers expressing only MHC I, fewer expressing MHC IIx, and fewer IIa/IIx hybrid fibers (P < 0.05). Hybrid IIa/IIx and I/IIa fibers were, respectively, negatively and positively related to training volume or average preferred racing distance (PRDA) in runners (P < 0.05). The relationship between IIa/IIx hybrid fibers and PRDA was more exponential (R(2) = 0.88) than linear (R(2) = 0.69). Only IIa/IIx hybrid fibers correlated negatively with exercise hours in nonrunners (P < 0.05). Their IIa/IIx hybrid fibers had MHC IIa content ranging from 1 to 99%, with most between 41 and 60%. Runners favoring longer distances (PRDA > 8 km or training > 70 km x wk(-1)) had no IIa/IIx hybrid fibers with MHC IIa proportion > 60%. In these runners, MHC I within hybrid I/IIa fibers was skewed toward higher proportions (> 60%), whereas MHC I proportions were skewed oppositely in runners favoring shorter training or racing distances.","Training volume influences both IIa/IIx and I/IIa hybrid fiber proportions in runners, but only the former in nonrunners. Hybrid IIa/IIx fiber proportions were modulated by racing distance. Distinctly different distributions of MHC isoforms within the hybrid fibers were seen in runners favoring longer distances versus those favoring shorter distances.",closed_qa
"External fixation in comminuted, displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal radius: is it sufficient?","External fixation has been extensively used to treat the intra-articular fractures of the distal radius and it has several distinct advantages over conventional POP cast and plate fixation. However, the limitation of external fixation to achieve articular congruity in the comminuted intra-articular fractures of the distal radius has been documented in the literature. This could be because external fixation alone does not expand crushed cancellous bone and cannot work without soft tissue hinges. This prospective study was conducted to look at the results of comminuted, displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal radius treated exclusively by external fixation. A 2-year follow-up of 27 patients with comminuted, displaced intra-articular fractures of distal radius that were treated exclusively by external fixation is presented. The radiological results, functional results and complications were analyzed according to the scoring system given by Jakim et al. Anatomical reduction could not be achieved in 12 patients (44%) and reduction was lost in two patients (7%). Excellent and good results were seen in 59.3%, fair results were seen in 22.2% and poor results were seen in 18.5% of the cases. Outcome scores of patients without articular step were significantly better as compared to the patients with articular step at healing. There was a positive correlation between the restoration of normal anatomy (radiological results) and the functional outcome (r=0.775). Overall nine patients (33%) had complications.","We conclude that although the external fixation is reliable in maintaining the reduction in displaced comminuted intra-articular fractures, it is inadequate in restoring articular congruity in many cases. The complications of external fixation are frequent and may be potentially serious in nature.",closed_qa
"Is dienogest as effective as intranasal buserelin acetate for the relief of pain symptoms associated with endometriosis -- a randomized , double-blind , multicenter , controlled trial?","To compare the efficacy and safety of dienogest (DNG) with intranasal buserelin acetate (BA) in patients with endometriosis. Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial. Twenty-four study centers in Japan. Two hundred seventy-one patients with endometriosis. Dienogest (2 mg/day, orally) or BA (900 microg/day, intranasally) for 24 weeks. The pre- to posttreatment changes in the scores of five subjective symptoms during nonmenstruation (lower abdominal pain, lumbago, defecation pain, dyspareunia, and pain on internal examination) and two objective findings (induration in the pouch of Douglas and limited uterine mobility). Dienogest reduced the scores of all symptoms and findings at the end of treatment, and the mean changes in the scores of all symptoms and findings except induration in the pouch of Douglas were comparable to those obtained with BA. Compared with BA, DNG was associated with irregular genital bleeding more frequently and with fewer hot flushes. The reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) during DNG treatment was significantly lower than that during BA treatment.","DNG is as effective as intranasal BA in alleviating endometriosis, and causes less BMD loss.",closed_qa
Do genotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from burn patients by RAPD-PCR?,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the important causes of nosocomial infections that easily gains resistance to many antibiotics. This opportunistic pathogen is a major health hazard particularly in immunodeficient patients, patients in intensive care units (ICU) and burn units with life threatening outcome. The bacterium may be originated from different or common sources, and comprises a high colonization and transmission capacity. The aim of present study was to investigate the genotypic variation of Pseudomonas aeroginosa strains isolated from burn patients by using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method. Totally 70 clinical samples were collected from burn patients in Taleghani Burn Hospital of Ahvaz. Fifty out of total samples were positive for P. aeruginosa by application of conventional culture and biochemical identification tests. DNA was extracted from the isolates and the RAPD-PCR method was applied to the DNA extracts according to standard method using a short single primer of 272. The technique created repetitive electrophoresis patterns which was used for genotypic differentiation. RAPD-PCR, created 9 genotypic profiles designated as I-IX with base pair length ranging from 180 to 2700. Each genotype showed between 3 and 6 different weight DNA bands. Genotype I was the most prevalent, identified in 10 bacterial isolates (20%). Genotypes I, II and VI were mostly common in patients with more severe burn, and were mainly isolated from wound and blood samples obtained from the same patients.","In present study, we found RAPD-PCR technique as a useful tool for investigation of the genetic variation among P. aeruginosa strains. This is a rapid, low cost, genotypic method with high discriminatory power.

Does molecular Characterization of Hypoxic Alveolar Epithelial Cells After Lung Contusion indicate an Important Role for HIF-1α?,"To understand the fate and regulation of hypoxic type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) after lung contusion (LC). LC due to thoracic trauma is a major risk factor for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. AECs have recently been implicated as a primary driver of inflammation in LC. The main pathological consequence of LC is hypoxia, and a key mediator of adaptation to hypoxia is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1. We have recently published that HIF-1α is a major driver of acute inflammation after LC through type II AEC. LC was induced in wild-type mice (C57BL/6), luciferase-based hypoxia reporter mice (ODD-Luc), and HIF-1α conditional knockout mice. The degree of hypoxia was assessed using hypoxyprobe and in vivo imaging system. The fate of hypoxic AEC was evaluated by luciferase dual staining with caspases-3 and Ki-67, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, and flow cytometry with ApoStat. NLRP-3 expression was determined by western blot. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate AECs in vivo, and collected RNA was analyzed by Q-PCR for HIF-related pathways. Global hypoxia was present after LC, but hypoxic foci were not uniform. Hypoxic AECs preferentially undergo apoptosis. There were significant reductions in NLRP-3 in HIF-1α conditional knockout mice. The expression of proteins involved in HIF-related pathways and inflammasome activation were significantly increased in hypoxic AECs.","These are the first in vivo data to identify, isolate, and characterize hypoxic AECs. HIF-1α regulation through hypoxic AECs is critical to the initiation of acute inflammation after LC.",closed_qa
Electrochemotherapy to Metastatic Spinal Melanoma: A Novel Treatment of Spinal Metastasis?,"Preliminary report of new antitumor treatment. To evaluate the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy as a novel treatment of spinal metastasis. Electrochemotherapy is a new antitumor treatment that combines systemic bleomycin with electric pulses delivered locally at the tumor site. These electric pulses permeabilize cell membranes in the tissue, allow bleomycin delivery diffusion inside the cells, and increase bleomycin cytotoxicity. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of electrochemotherapy in the treatment of several primary and metastatic solid tumors. Treatment planning for electrode positioning and electrical pulse parameters was prepared for 4 needle electrodes. Mini-open surgery with a left L5 laminectomy was performed to introduce the eletrodes. The patient was treated according to the established Electrochemotherapy Protocol with Bleomycin. Clinical efficacy of electrochemotherapy was evaluated according to a visual analog scale of pain, Oswestry Disability Index 2.0, the Karnofsky Performance Scale, and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The assessed follow-up period was 48 months after the electrochemotherapy procedure. Neither serious electrochemotherapy-related adverse events, nor bleomycin toxicity were reported. Overall improvement in pain according to Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 and Karnofsky Performance Scale outcomes was better.","Our case represents, to our knowledge, the first one to test the potential role of electrochemotherapy as treatment of spinal metastasis. Electrochemotherapy allowed a successful treatment of metastatic spinal melanoma. However, we believe that there is a strong scientific rationale to support the potential utility of electrochemotherapy as a novel treatment of spinal metastasis, regardless of the histological types.",closed_qa
Does tNF receptor-associated factor 6 suppression inhibit inflammatory response to Porphyromonas gingivialis in human periodontal ligament cells?,"Periodontitis is a group of inflammatory diseases caused by microorganisms. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative bacteria, is strongly associated with the onset of periodontitis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) represents an important target in the regulation of many disease processes, including immunity, inflammation, and osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TRAF6 for inflammatory response in P gingivalis-infected human periodontal ligament cells (HPDLCs). HPDLCs were stimulated with 1 x 108 CFU/mL P gingivalis, or 10 ug/mL P gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS), separately in the absence or presence of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for TRAF6. The expression of TRAF6 was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Concentrations of IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 in the culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this study, we found that both P gingivalis and its LPS treatment increased the expression of TRAF6 and proinflammatory cytokine production in HPDLCs. In addition, we used siRNA for TRAF6, and the inhibition of TRAF6 expression reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines in HPDLCs stimulated with P gingivalis and its LPS.",The results suggested that TRAF6 may be a key molecule to control proinflammatory cytokine production induced by P gingivalis and its LPS.

Monocyte-derived DCs from patients with RCC were cultured in vitro and randomly divided into three groups: sunitinib combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS only and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment. Sunitinib plus LPS group was pretreated with 200 ng/mL sunitinib for 12 hours followed by stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 24 hours; LPS group was pretreated with 1 μL/mL DMSO for 12 hours and then stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS for 24 hours; DMSO group was treated with 1 μL/mL DMSO for 36 hours. Morphological changes were observed by an inverted microscope. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expressions of PD-L1, PD-L2, CD80, CD86, B7-H4 and HVEM. Sunitinib-LPS co-treated and LPS-treated cells had typical dendrites, while DMSO-treated cells had no obvious dendrites. Compared with the LPS-treated group, the expressions of CD80, PD-L1 and B7-H4 on DCs significantly decreased in the sunitinib-LPS group; the expressions of PD-L1, PD-L2, CD80, CD86, B7-H4 and HVEM were lower in the DMSO group.","Sunitinib inhibits the expressions of CD80, PD-L1 and B7-H4 on DCs induced by LPS.",closed_qa
Does intensive lifestyle modification reduce Lp-PLA2 in dyslipidemic HIV/HAART patients?,"Patients with dyslipidemia associated with HIV-1 infection and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have elevated levels of Lp-PLA2 and CCL5/regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to determine whether an intensive diet and exercise (D/E) program, independently or combined with fenofibrate or niacin, could reduce Lp-PLA2 or RANTES. Patients with hypertriglyceridemic HIV on stable HAART (n = 107) were randomized to one of five interventions: 1) usual care, 2) D/E with placebos, 3) D/E with fenofibrate and placebo, 4) D/E with niacin and placebo, or 5) D/E with fenofibrate and niacin for 24 wk. Lp-PLA2 and RANTES concentrations were measured in fasting plasma samples at baseline and postintervention. General linear models were used to compare Lp-PLA2 and RANTES levels between the five groups postintervention, controlling for baseline levels, age, body mass index, CD4 T-cell count, viral load, duration of infection, and HAART. At baseline, fasting plasma Lp-PLA2 (388.5 ± 127.5 ng·mL) and RANTES (43.8 ± 25.5 ng·mL) levels were elevated when compared with healthy controls. Posttreatment Lp-PLA2 mass was lower in patients who received D/E only (323.0 ± 27.2 ng·mL), D/E plus fenofibrate (327.2 ± 25.9 ng·mL), and D/E plus niacin (311.1 ± 27.8 ng·mL) when compared with patients receiving usual care (402.2 ± 25.3 ng·mL).

Does accurate measurement of small airways on low-dose thoracic CT scan in smokers?,"Partial volume averaging and tilt relative to the scan plane on transverse images limit the accuracy of airway wall thickness measurements on CT scan, confounding assessment of the relationship between airway remodeling and clinical status in COPD. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of partial volume averaging and tilt corrections on airway wall thickness measurement accuracy and on relationships between airway wall thickening and clinical status in COPD. Airway wall thickness measurements in 80 heavy smokers were obtained on transverse images from low-dose CT scan using the open-source program Airway Inspector. Measurements were corrected for partial volume averaging and tilt effects using an attenuation- and geometry-based algorithm and compared with functional status. The algorithm reduced wall thickness measurements of smaller airways to a greater degree than larger airways, increasing the overall range. When restricted to analyses of airways with an inner diameter < 3.0 mm, for a theoretical airway of 2.0 mm inner diameter, the wall thickness decreased from 1.07 ± 0.07 to 0.29 ± 0.10 mm, and the square root of the wall area decreased from 3.34 ± 0.15 to 1.58 ± 0.29 mm, comparable to histologic measurement studies. Corrected measurements had higher correlation with FEV₁, differed more between BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity (BODE) index scores, and explained a greater proportion of FEV1 variability in multivariate models.","Correcting for partial volume averaging improves accuracy of airway wall thickness estimation, allowing direct measurement of the small airways to better define their role in COPD.",closed_qa
Pulmonary tuberculosis in the adult in a low prevalence area: is the radiological presentation changing?,"Pulmonary division of a university hospital in Belgium, an area with a relatively low tuberculosis incidence (14.9 per 100 000 population in 1993). To evaluate whether 'unusual' radiographic presentations of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) have increased in recent years, especially in elderly and non-indigenous patients. Retrospective study of chest X-rays of 219 patients aged over 18 years with bacteriologically proven PTB in the period 1981-1990, including 92 elderly (>or =65 years) and 17 non-indigenous patients. 'Unusual' presentations consisted of solitary pleural effusion, isolated hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathies, normal chest X-ray, lower lung field TB, nodular lesions, diffuse infiltrations and atelectasis. There was an increase in 'unusual' presentations, from 24% in 1981-1985 to 35% in 1986-1990, yet this was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). This increase tended to be more pronounced in the elderly age group, i.e., from 24% to 42% compared to 23% to 31% in the younger age group. The proportion of elderly patients in the group with 'unusual' findings was 44% in 1981-1985 and 48% in 1986-1990.

Does lariciresinol-4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside from the root of Isatis indigotica inhibit influenza A virus-induced pro-inflammatory response?,"Isatis indigotica is a traditional Chinese medicine. Its dried roots named ""ban lan gen"" in Chinese, are used for clinical treatment of virus infection, tumor, inflammation with a long history. However, its anti-influenza active ingredient and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, the anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory effects of a lignan glycoside: lariciresinol-4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside isolated from the root of I. indigotica on human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 infected with influenza A virus were investigated. Chemical and spectroscopic methods were employed to identify the structure of the lignan glycoside. Cytotoxicity of the lignan glycoside was analyzed using methylthiazolyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. The inhibitory activity against influenza virus of the lignan was determined by CPE inhibition assay. HEK-293 cells stably co-transfected with NF-κB responsive firefly luciferase and constitutively expressing GFP were employed for monitoring the effect of the lignan on NF-κB signal pathway activation. Nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to quantify the expression profiling of cytokines and chemokines after infection with influenza virus. We showed that the lignan glycoside treatment was effective against the influenza A virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in MDCK cells. Further study demonstrated the lignan glycoside attenuated virus-induced NF-κB activation, but did not affect export of viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes from the nucleus in late stages of infection. We revealed that the lignan glycoside suppressed influenza A virus (H1N1)-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory molecules IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, MCP-1, IP-10 and IFN-α. Moreover, the cytokines and chemokines profiles induced by H9N2 virus resembled those of influenza virus H1N1, but the lignan glycoside reduced the expression of IP-10 and TNF-α.",Our results suggest that the lignan glycoside is a bioactive component of I. indigotica which may contribute an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for influenza virus infection.,closed_qa
Do ramped hybrid encoding for improved ultrashort echo time imaging?,"We propose a new acquisition to minimize the per-excitation encoding duration and improve the imaging capability for short T2 * species. In the proposed ramped hybrid encoding (RHE) technique, gradients are applied before the radiofrequency (RF) pulse as in pointwise encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA) and zero echo time (ZTE) imaging. However, in RHE, gradients are rapidly ramped after RF excitation to the maximum amplitude to minimize encoding duration. To acquire central k-space data not measured during RF deadtime, RHE uses a hybrid encoding scheme similar to PETRA. A new gradient calibration method based on single-point imaging was developed to estimate the k-space trajectory and enable robust and high quality reconstruction. RHE enables a shorter per-excitation encoding time and provides the highest spatial resolution among ultrashort T2 * imaging methods. In phantom and in vivo experiments, RHE exhibited robust imaging with negligible chemical shift or blurriness caused by T2 * decay and unwanted slice selection.","RHE allows the shortest per-excitation encoding time for ultrashort T2 * imaging, which alleviates the impact of fast T2 * decay occurring during encoding, and enables improved spatial resolution.

Is tumor necrosis factor-α associated with positive lymph node status in patients with recurrence of colorectal cancer-indications for anti-TNF-α agents in cancer treatment?,The progressive growth of malignancies is accompanied by a decline in the immune response through mechanisms which are poorly understood. Apoptosis and induction of inflammation by tumor released cytokines as tumor escape mechanisms have been proposed to play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Expression of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was analyzed in colorectal cancer specimen and the cancer cell line HT-29 by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. TNF-α expression on protein and mRNA level were correlated with clinical characteristics and impact on survival. TNFR-1 was co-labelled with TNF-α and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in immunofluorescence double staining experiments. 94% (n = 98/104) of the patients with CRC expressed TNF-α. High TNF-α expression was significantly associated with positive lymph node stage and recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis revealed high TNF-α expression as an independent prognostic factor. Immunohistochemistry was correlated with RT-PCR results (т = 0.794). Immunofluorescence double staining experiments revealed increased TNFR-1 expression by CD8+ cells.,"TNF-α expression by tumor cells may be an efficient immunological escape mechanism by inflammation-enhanced metastases and probably by induction of apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ immune cells resulting in a down regulation of the tumoral immune response. Our data support the role of tumor-derived TNF-α expression as an important promoter of tumoral immune escape mechanisms and malignant progression, and suggest that analysis on either protein (immunohistochemistry) or RNA level (RT-PCR) can be used effectively in this respect. Targeting TNF-α may be a promising option, especially in cases with high TNF-α expression and positive lymph node metastases.",closed_qa
Does increased ratio of glutamate/glutamine to creatine in the right hippocampus contribute to depressive symptoms in patients with epilepsy?,Our study aimed to investigate whether the glutamatergic system in the hippocampus is correlated with depressive symptoms in patients with epilepsy. Fifty patients with epilepsy were recruited and divided into three groups on the basis of their Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores. Single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was carried out. Pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to investigate any correlation between the variables of hippocampal metabolites and HAMD scores. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis showed that the ratio of glutamate/glutamine to creatine (Glx/Cr) in the right hippocampus was significantly increased in patients with moderate depression and correlated positively with HAMD scores. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the ratio of Glx/Cr in the right hippocampus was an independent risk factor relating to depressive symptoms in patients with epilepsy.,A disturbance of the hippocampal glutamatergic system may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression in epilepsy.,closed_qa
Does alcohol disrupt endoplasmic reticulum function and protein secretion in hepatocytes?,"Many alcoholic patients have serum protein deficiency that contributes to their systemic problems. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is induced in response to disequilibrium in the protein folding capability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is implicated in hepatocyte lipid accumulation and apoptosis, which are associated with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We investigated whether alcohol affects ER structure, function, and UPR activation in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. HepG2 cells expressing human cytochrome P450 2E1 and mouse alcohol dehydrogenase (VL-17A) were treated for up to 48 hours with 50 and 100 mM ethanol. Zebrafish larvae at 4 days postfertilization were exposed to 350 mM ethanol for 32 hours. ER morphology was visualized by fluorescence in cells and transmission electron microscopy in zebrafish. UPR target gene activation was assessed using quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization, and Western blotting. Mobility of the major ER chaperone, BIP, was monitored in cells by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). VL-17A cells metabolized alcohol yet only had slight activation of some UPR target genes following ethanol treatment. However, ER fragmentation, crowding, and accumulation of unfolded proteins as detected by immunofluorescence and FRAP demonstrate that alcohol induced some ER dysfunction despite the lack of UPR activation. Zebrafish treated with alcohol, however, showed modest ER dilation, and several UPR targets were significantly induced.",Ethanol metabolism directly impairs ER structure and function in hepatocytes. Zebrafish are a novel in vivo system for studying ALD.,closed_qa
Can oral health-related quality of life measures substitute for normative needs assessments in 11 to 12-year-old children?,"1) assess the relationship between a measure of condition-specific oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and the related normative need for dental treatments, and 2) test the diagnostic validity of the condition-specific OHRQoL measure for specific dental conditions in a group of primary school children. A cross-sectional study of all 11 to 12 year-olds carried out in a municipal area of Suphanburi province, Thailand. 1034 children (91.8%) were dentally examined to assess their normative needs for 6 types of treatment (dental caries, traumatic dental injuries, enamel defects, periodontal, orthodontic and prosthodontic treatment). OHRQoL was assessed using the Child-OIDP index and its Condition-Specific impacts measure for the 6 treatment types. The prevalence of specific types of normative needs ranged from 3.2% (prosthodontic) to 97.0% (periodontal) and for Condition-Specific oral impacts from 0.7% (prosthodontic) to 50.6% (dental caries). Despite their statistically significant relationship for every treatment type except for periodontal treatment when need was indicated by a CPI score of 1, there were large differences between measures of normative need and oral impacts. High proportions of children had normative need without impacts and vice versa. The biggest differences were for appearance-related conditions (e.g. enamel defects and orthodontic treatment). For every type of treatment, oral impacts poorly predicted the normative needs of individuals.","Although normative needs and OHRQoL are associated, when assessed appropriately, there was considerable discrepancy between them. OHRQoL measures cannot replace normative needs. Instead, both should be used in combination in order to cover different dimensions of oral health.",closed_qa
Does type 1 equilibrative nucleoside transporter regulate astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in the striatum?,"Adenosine signaling has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Previously, we found that astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) are downregulated in the striatum of mice lacking type 1 equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1). To further investigate the gene expression profile in the striatum, we preformed Illumina Mouse Whole Genome BeadChip microarray analysis of the caudate-putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in ENT1 null mice. Gene expression was validated by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Using transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, we examined EGFP expression in an ENT1 null background. Glial fibrillary acidic protein was identified as a top candidate gene that was reduced in ENT1 null mice compared to wild-type littermates. Furthermore, EGFP expression was significantly reduced in GFAP-EGFP transgenic mice in an ENT1 null background in both the CPu and NAc. Finally, pharmacological inhibition or siRNA knockdown of ENT1 in cultured astrocytes also reduced GFAP mRNA levels.","Overall, our findings demonstrate that ENT1 regulates GFAP expression and possibly astrocyte function.",closed_qa
Does iL-13 signaling via IL-13R alpha2 induce major downstream fibrogenic factors mediating fibrosis in chronic TNBS colitis?,"Previous studies have shown that fibrosis developing in chronic experimental colitis is driven by interleukin (IL)-13 signaling via IL-13R alpha(2) and the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. In the present study, we sought to determine the fibrogenic downstream events set in motion by such signaling. Experimental colitis with late-onset intestinal fibrosis was induced by weekly intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to BALB/c mice. Blockade of IL-13 signaling via IL-13R alpha(2) and TGF-beta1 signaling was achieved by the administration of small interfering RNA or decoy oligonucleotides that target promoter sequences of signaling components of these receptors. Effects of blockade were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blotting detecting specific key fibrogenic factors and by measurement of collagen production. Initially, we showed that abrogation of IL-13 activity via blockade of IL-13R alpha(2) and TGF-beta1 signaling results in severe inhibition of expression of colonic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and early growth response gene (Egr)-1, factors known to initiate and sustain fibrosis. We then showed that Egr-1 was necessary early in the fibrotic process for caspase-mediated apoptosis of myofibroblasts and the production of urokinase plasminogen activator, a protein that enhances TGF-beta1 activation. Finally, we showed that IGF-I (together with TGF-beta1) acts later in the process to stimulate myofibroblasts to deposit collagen in the colon.","These studies establish that IL-13 signaling via the IL-13R alpha(2) is a key initiation point for a complex fibrotic program in the colon consisting of TGF-beta1 activation, IGF-I and Egr-1 expression, myofibroblast apoptosis, and myofibroblast production of collagen.",closed_qa
"Is traffic-related air pollution exposure associated with allergic sensitization , asthma , and poor lung function in middle age?","Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure is associated with allergic airway diseases and reduced lung function in children, but evidence concerning adults, especially in low-pollution settings, is scarce and inconsistent. We sought to determine whether exposure to TRAP in middle age is associated with allergic sensitization, current asthma, and reduced lung function in adults, and whether these associations are modified by variants in Glutathione S-Transferase genes. The study sample comprised the proband 2002 laboratory study of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study.

Is the T-786C endothelial nitric oxide synthase genotype a novel risk factor for coronary artery disease in Caucasian patients of the GENICA study?,"We investigated the association of polymorphisms in the promoter region and exon 7 endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene with coronary artery disease (CAD). Endothelial dysfunction foretells cardiovascular events and can be genetically determined. We genotyped for the promoter (T(-786)C) and exon 7 (Glu298Asp, G(894)T) polymorphisms in 1,225 subjects; 1,106 were consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography and 119 control subjects without any cardiovascular risk factors. Genotyping was performed with melting curve analysis of polymerase chain reaction products from allele-specific acceptor and donor probes that were 5'- and 3'-end labeled with LCRed640 and fluorescein, respectively; CAD was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis for the effect of the T(-786)C, the missense Glu298Asp variant, and other coronary risk factors on two- and three-vessel CAD. The overall genotype distribution of T(-786)C (CC = 17.7%, CT = 40.4%, and TT = 41.9%) and Glu298Asp (GG = 43.3%, GT = 37.0%, and TT = 19.7%) was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The regression analysis showed that the T(-786)C, but not the missense Glu298Asp variant, significantly predicted CAD, independent of other risk factors. Compared with TT homozygous, subjects carrying the C allele had a significant (p = 0.002) increase in the odds ratio of harboring two- or three-vessel CAD of 1.672 (95% confidence interval, 1.062 to 2.527). A subgroup analysis confirmed this effect of the T(-786)C polymorphism in men (p = 0.007), cigarette smokers (p = 0.001), subjects older than 60 years of age (p = 0.007), with hypercholesterolemia (p = 0.011), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.006), and overweight or with obesity (p = 0.041).",The C allele at the T(-786)C endothelial nitric oxide synthase polymorphism is associated with a higher risk of multivessel CAD in Caucasians.,closed_qa
Does human cytomegalovirus infection induce leukotriene B4 and 5-lipoxygenase expression in human placentae and umbilical vein endothelial cells?,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can cause congenital infection with risk of neurological disability. Maternal-fetal transmission is associated with placental inflammation. 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of Leukotrienes (LTs), which are proinflammatory mediators. This study investigated the effect of HCMV infection on 5-LO expression and Leukotriene-B4 (LTB4) induction in human placentae and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Seven placentae from fetuses with congenital HCMV infection and brain damage and six controls were stained with HCMV-immediate-early-antigen (HCMV-IEA) and 5-LO by immunohistochemistry. 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and LTB4 were measured in culture supernatant from ex vivo HCMV-infected placental histocultures by liquid chromatography. In vitro, HCMV infected HUVEC cells were analyzed for 5-LO mRNA and protein expression by real time PCR and immunofluorescence staining. HCMV-IEA was abundant in all HCMV infected placentae but absent in control placentae. 5-LO expression was higher in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of HCMV-infected placentae, compared to control placentae. HCMV infection induced an up-regulation of LTB4 in ex vivo placental explants with higher levels of LTB4 at 72 h compared to controls (p = 0.002). In vitro, 5-LO transcript and protein expression were significantly induced in HCMV-infected HUVEC, compared to the control cultures (p = 0.036).",The presence of HCMV coincided with high 5-LO expression in cells of in vivo HCMV infected placentae. HCMV induced up-regulation of 5-LO in both ex vivo HCMV-infected placental explants and HUVEC. HCMV induced LT-biosynthesis in congenitally infected placentae may have a role in pathogenesis of congenital HCMV disease.,closed_qa
Is the clinical presentation different between men and women admitting to the sleep laboratory?,"Sleep and sleep disorders are different in several important ways between men and women. We aimed to investigate gender differences in initial symptoms and associating medical diseases of patients admitting to our sleep clinic. Ninety-one patients, 20 women (22%) and 71 men (78%), admitting consecutively to the sleep clinic were studied. A detailed sleep and medical history of the patients was recorded. All patients were questioned for Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and underwent an entire night of diagnostic polysomnography. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was identified as the total number of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep. Hypopnea was defined as a decrease of airflow by at least 50% and desaturations were defined as>or=4% decrease in oxygen saturation. The mean values for age, body mass index, blood pressures and ESS score did not significantly differ between men and women, but AHI (events/h) was significantly higher in men (29.1 +/- 22.7) than women (17.9 +/- 17.7, p<0.05). Snoring was the most common symptom in both men (95%) and women (90%). Among the main presenting complaints, only morning headache (12 of women 60%, 31 of men 43%, p = 0.04) and dry mouth on awakening (ten of women 50%, 57 of men 80%, p = 0.02) showed a significant difference between the two genders, while among the medical diseases only hypothyroidism (four of women 20% and three of men 4%, p = 0.03) and depression (nine of women 45% and 16 of men 22%, p = 0.02) were seen as statistically higher in women than in men.","Primary care physicians should be aware of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in women and the importance of referring women for sleep studies when they complain of symptoms associated with OSA, even if other non-specific symptoms such as morning headaches are reported. Also, hypothyroidism and depression are accompanied with sleep disorders especially in women.",closed_qa
Are unilateral prefrontal direct current stimulation effects modulated by working memory load and gender?,"Recent studies revealed that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may improve verbal working memory (WM) performance in humans. In the present study, we evaluated executive attention, which is the core of WM capacity, considered to be significantly involved in tasks that require active maintenance of memory representations in interference-rich conditions, and is highly dependent on DLPFC function. We investigated verbal WM accuracy using a WM task that is highly sensitive to executive attention function. We were interested in how verbal WM accuracy may be affected by WM load, unilateral DLPFC stimulation, and gender, as previous studies showed gender-dependent brain activation during verbal WM tasks. We utilized a modified verbal n-Back task hypothesized to increase demands on executive attention. We examined ""online"" WM performance while participants received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and implicit learning performance in a post-stimulation WM task. Significant lateralized ""online"" stimulation effects were found only in the highest WM load condition revealing that males benefit from left DLPFC stimulation, while females benefit from right DLPFC stimulation. High WM load performance in the left DLPFC stimulation was significantly related to post-stimulation recall performance.","Our findings support the idea that lateralized stimulation effects in high verbal WM load may be gender-dependent. Further, our post-stimulation results support the idea that increased left hemisphere activity may be important for encoding verbal information into episodic memory as well as for facilitating retrieval of context-specific targets from semantic memory.",closed_qa
Does age trends and sex differences of alpha rhythms including split alpha peak?,"To investigate age trends, sex differences, and splitting of alpha peaks of the EEG spectrum in the healthy population. An automated multi-site algorithm was used to parametrize the alpha rhythm in 1498 healthy subjects aged 6-86 years. Alpha peaks identified from multiple electrode sites were organized into clusters of similar frequencies whose sex differences and age trends were investigated. Significant age-related trends were observed for frequency, position, and amplitude of dominant alpha peaks. Occipital sites had alpha clusters of higher average frequency, higher power, and greater presence across the scalp. Frequency and power differences were found between the sexes.",Observed increases in alpha frequency in children and decreases in the elderly were consistent with those from earlier studies. A large fraction of participants (≈ 44%) showed multiple distinct alpha rhythm thus investigations which only examine the alpha frequency with the highest peak power can produce misleading results. The strong dependence of alpha frequency on age and anterior-posterior position indicates use of a fixed alpha frequency band is insufficient to capture the full characteristics of the alpha rhythm.,closed_qa
Is regulation of Cdc42 expression and signaling critical for promoting corneal epithelial wound healing?,"Cdc42, a member of Rho GTPases (guanosine triphosphatases), participates in cytokine- and growth factor-controlled biological functions in mammalian tissues. Here, we examined Cdc42 role in corneal epithelial wound healing and the influence of hepatocyte, keratinocyte, and epidermal growth factor (HGF, KGF, and EGF)-mediated signaling on Cdc42. Epithelial wounds were created on the corneas of live rabbits by complete debridement and in rabbit corneal epithelial primary cultures through scratch injury. Cdc42 expression in cultures was suppressed using Cdc42 siRNA. Cdc42 activation was determined by pull-down assays with PAK-agarose beads. Cdc42 expression was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Association of Cdc42 with cell-cycle proteins was identified by immunoprecipitation. In rabbit corneas, significant increase in Cdc42 expression that occurred 2 to 4 days after the injury coincided with wound closure, and by 8 days the expression reached near basal levels. Silencing of Cdc42 expression in cultures caused inhibition of wound closure as a result of 60% to 75% decrease in epithelial migration and growth. HGF, KGF, and EGF increased Cdc2 expression, activation, and its phosphorylation on ser71. Inhibition of growth factor-mediated PI-3K signaling resulted in the downregulation of Cdc42 expression and its phosphorylation. Increased association of cell-cycle proteins p27(kip) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) with Cdc42; and phosphorylated Cdc42 with plasma membrane leading edges was also observed in the presence of growth factors.","Cdc42 is an important regulator of corneal epithelial wound repair. To promote healing, Cdc42 may interact with receptor tyrosine kinase-activated signaling cascades that participate in cell migration and cell-cycle progression.",closed_qa
Does severe obstructive sleep apnoea exacerbate the microvascular impairment in very mild hypertensives?,"Different studies have shown that obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), frequently associated with hypertension, represents a harmful and independent risk for cardiovascular diseases. The aim of our study was to ascertain whether the occurrence of OSAS could worsen microcirculatory impairment in very mild hypertensives. One hundred untreated very mild hypertensives underwent polysomnography and subdivided into 32 non-OSAS, 33 mild OSAS and 35 severe OSAS patients on standardized criteria. They underwent routine blood chemistry, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and anthropometric analysis. Skin capillary density (n mm(-2)) of forearm (FAC) and periungueal (PUC) fields was obtained through videocapillaroscopy. By a venous congestion manoeuvre, PUC was maximized (CVC) and secondary capillary recruitment (GAIN) was calculated. These measurements served as indices of structural and functional capillary rarefaction, respectively. Severe OSAS hypertensives showed reduced FAC (P < 0.001) and PUC (P < 0.001) as compared to those with mild OSAS and non-OSAS, but a greater CVC (P < 0.01) and GAIN (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that PUC was inversely related to total sleep time with oxyhaemoglobin saturation at < 90% (TST90) (P < 0.001) and FAC to the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) (P < 0.001) and to the sleep propensity (P < 0.01). CVC was positively associated to AHI (P < 0.001) and GAIN to TST90 (P < 0.05).","The findings suggest that OSAS, by means of reduced basal and functional capillarity rarefaction, might pose an additional risk of impaired peripheral perfusion in very mild hypertensives. A microcirculation study therefore should be a part of the clinical approach in patients at high cerebro-cardiovascular risk such as hypertensives and patients with OSAS.",closed_qa
Is toll-like receptor 4 immunohistochemical expression enhanced in macrophages of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques?,"A growing body of evidence supports a role for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a primary receptor of the innate immune system, in atherosclerosis initiation and progression. Carotid atheroma macrophages (MACs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) express TLR4; nevertheless, correlations with epidemiological and clinical variables and especially cerebrovascular symptomatology remain unsettled. Carotid atherosclerotic plaques were obtained by standard carotid endarterectomy on 157 patients with carotid artery disease (84 asymptomatic - 73 symptomatic). TLR4 expression in MACs and SMCs of carotid atheroma was detected by immunohistochemistry techniques. TLR4 positivity, overexpression and intensity of immunostaining in MACs and SMCs were correlated with cerebrovascular symptomatology, epidemiological and clinical variables. MAC TLR4 positivity was noted in 129 (82.2%) patients. Patients receiving statins had significantly lower TLR4 expression. Rates of MAC TLR4 positivity were higher among symptomatic patients (odds ratio, OR = 5.1; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.8-14.3; p < 0.001); the association was stronger for transient ischemic attacks. TLR4 overexpression was also significantly enhanced among symptomatic patients (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.02-5.03; p < 0.05). No correlations were detected between SMC TLR4 expression and cerebrovascular symptoms. In multivariate models adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, hyperlipidemia and smoking, MAC TLR4 positivity was associated with a cerebrovascular event during the last 6 months (OR = 4; 95% CI = 1.2-13.3; p = 0.02).",Symptomatic carotid artery plaques are characterized by increased expression of TLR4 in macrophages supporting a potential role for TLR4 in the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of cerebrovascular disease.

"Are rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody positivity , but not level , associated with increased mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis : results from two large independent cohorts?","This study aimed to investigate rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) status and levels as predictors of mortality in two large cohorts of patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EIA). Data from the Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR) and Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (EAC) cohorts were used. At baseline, patients had demographic data and smoking status recorded; RF, ACPA and inflammatory markers were measured in the local laboratories. Patients were flagged with national death registers until death or censor date. Antibody status was stratified as negative, low or high positive by RF and ACPA levels individually. In addition, patients were grouped as seronegative, RF positive, ACPA positive or double antibody (RF and ACPA) positive. Cox regression models explored associations between antibody status and mortality adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, inflammatory markers and year of enrolment. A total of 4962 patients were included, 64% were female. Median age at onset was 56 (NOAR) and 54 (EAC) years. In NOAR and EAC respectively, 35% and 42% of patients were ACPA/RF positive. When antibody status was stratified as negative, low or high positive, there were no consistent findings between the two cohorts. Double antibody positivity was associated with excess mortality in both cohorts compared to seronegative patients: NOAR and EAC respective adjusted HR (95% confidence interval) 1.35 (1.09 to 1.68) and 1.58 (1.16 to 2.15).",Patients with EIA who are seropositive for both RF and ACPA have increased mortality compared to those who are single positive or seronegative.

Do measurement and analysis of access resistance and polarization impedance in cochlear implant recipients?,"Impedance measurements are commonly performed at the end of cochlear implant surgery, not only to confirm that all electrodes are working but also to monitor the impedances of the newly implanted electrodes. The current method of testing allows the determination of only the overall electrode impedance but not its components, access resistance and polarization impedance. To determine whether any longitudinal change in the electrode impedance is caused by a change in the endocochlear environment or rather caused by a change in the surface quality of the electrode, it is necessary to extract access resistance and polarization impedance. We applied an impedance model that enabled us to calculate access resistance and polarization impedance after measurement of electrode impedance at three points along the voltage waveform. The results show that the value of the components of electrode impedance varied with time after surgery: access resistance increased slowly over time, whereas polarization impedance increased up to Week 2 but decreased after commencement of electrical stimulation at that stage. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a layer of fibrous tissue forms around the electrode within the cochlear canal, resulting in a slow increase of access resistance, whereas a layer of proteins forms on the surface of the electrode in the early phase after implantation. Electrical stimulation appears to disperse this surface layer, thereby reducing both the polarization impedance and electrode impedance.",The method presented enables the extraction of more detailed information about the longitudinal changes in the intracochlear environment after cochlear implantation.,closed_qa
Does regulation of microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT ) by miR-34c-5p determine the chemosensitivity of gastric cancer to paclitaxel?,"Human miR-34c has been reported to be associated with various human malignancies; however, it remains unknown whether miR-34c is involved in chemoresistance in gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-34c in gastric cancer. The adenosine triphosphate-based tumor chemosensitivity assay was used to measure drug sensitivity in gastric cancer samples. The expression levels of miRNA were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and those of protein were by Western blot analysis. Luciferase activity assay was used to verify the target genes of miRNAs. MTT assay was used to test the drug-resistant phenotype changes in cancer cells via overregulation of miRNAs. The methylation status of neighboring CpG islands of miR-34c-5p was analyzed by Bisulfite Sequencing PCR and methylation-specific PCR. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that expression of miR-34c-5p was downregulated in paclitaxel-resistant gastric cancer samples (p < 0.01). Cells derived from gastric cancer tissues with low miR-34c-5p expression and high microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) protein expression tended to have increased chemoresistance to paclitaxel in vitro. Luciferase activity assay confirmed that the 3'-UTR of MAPT mRNA contains a functional miR-34c-5p binding site. Overexpression of miR-34c-5p significantly downregulated MAPT protein expression and increased the chemosensitivity of paclitaxel-resistant gastric cancer cells. Further investigation demonstrated that differential methylation of CpG islands neighboring the miR-34c promoter regulated the expression of miR-34c-5p in gastric cancer cell lines.","DNA methylation, dysregulation of miR-34c-5p, and MAPT expression are critical factors in the chemoresistance of gastric cancer to paclitaxel.",closed_qa
Does central fatigue explain reduced cycling after complete sleep deprivation?,"Sleep deprivation (SD) is characterized by reduced cognitive capabilities and endurance exercise performance and increased perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise. The combined effects of SD and exercise-induced changes in neuromuscular function and cognition are unknown. This study aimed to determine whether central fatigue is greater with SD, and if so, whether this corresponds to diminished cognitive and physical responses. Twelve active males performed two 2-d conditions (SD and control (CO)). On day 1, subjects performed baseline cognitive and neuromuscular testing. After one night of SD or normal sleep, subjects repeated day 1 testing and then performed 40-min submaximal cycling and a cycling test to task failure. Neuromuscular and cognitive functions were evaluated during the cycling protocol and at task failure. After SD, exercise time to task failure was shorter (1137 ± 253 vs 1236 ± 282 s, P = 0.013) and RPE during 40 min submaximal cycling was greater (P = 0.009) than that in CO. Maximal peripheral voluntary activation decreased by 7% (P = 0.003) and cortical voluntary activation tended to decrease by 5% (P = 0.059) with exercise. No other differences in neuromuscular function or cognitive control were observed between conditions. After SD, mean reaction time was 8% longer (P = 0.011) and cognitive response omission rate before cycling was higher (P<0.05) than that in CO. Acute submaximal exercise counteracted cognitive performance deterioration in SD.",One night of complete SD resulted in decreased time to task failure and cognitive performance and higher RPE compared with the control condition. The lack of difference in neuromuscular function between CO and SD indicates that decreased SD exercise performance was probably not caused by increased muscular or central fatigue.,closed_qa
Is maternal or zygotic sphingosine kinase required to regulate zebrafish cardiogenesis?,"The sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway regulates zebrafish cardiogenesis, and provides a paradigm for how signaling gradients coordinate collective cell migration across tissue layers. It is known that the S1P transporter (Spns2) functions in extra-embryonic YSL to activate G protein-coupled receptor (S1pr2) signaling in endoderm for deposition of positional cues (integrin, fibronectin, etc.). Such cues are recognized by overlying lateral precardiac mesoderm that migrates to the midline and fuses to form the primordial heart tube. However, the source of bio-active S1P is not known. There are multiple receptors and it is not known if there are earlier or even receptor-independent functions for S1P. Because S1P can only be generated by sphingosine kinases, we targeted a mutation to the single kinase gene expressed during early embryogenesis (sphk2). Zygotic mutants survive to adulthood and appear normal, but maternal-zygotic mutant embryos phenocopy null zygotic mutants of spns2 or s1pr2.","The data show that maternally derived sphk2 RNA is fully sufficient to generate an S1P signaling gradient in the YSL that ultimately controls precardiac mesoderm migration during embryogenesis. Furthermore, despite maternal expression of sphk2, there are no obvious developmental functions requiring its activity prior to stimulation of S1pr2 in endoderm.",closed_qa
Does low Plasma Proportion of Omega 3-Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids predict Poor Outcome in Acute Non-Cardiogenic Ischemic Stroke Patients?,"Alterations in blood fatty acid (FA) composition are associated with cardiovascular diseases. We investigated whether plasma FA composition was related to stroke severity and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients. We prospectively enrolled 156 patients with first-episode cerebral infarction, within 7 days of symptom onset. The proportion of FAs was analyzed using gas chromatography, and the summation of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3-PUFA), 18:3 ω3 α-linolenic acid, 20:3 ω3 eicosatrienoic acid, 20:5 ω3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 22:6 ω3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reported as Σω3-PUFAs. Stroke severity was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission. Poor functional outcome was defined by modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≥3 at three months after the index stroke. Lower proportions of EPA (β=-0.751), DHA (β=-0.610), and Σω3-PUFAs (β=-0.462) were independently associated with higher NIHSS score, after adjusting for stroke subtype, hemoglobin, high density lipoprotein, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, fasting glucose, 16:0 palmitic acid, and Σsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, a lower proportion of DHA (odds ratio [OR]: 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.04-0.88), and Σω3-PUFAs (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.84) showed an independent relationship with poor functional outcome after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, NIHSS score, stroke subtype, and 16:0 palmitic acid.",Our results demonstrate that ω3-PUFAs correlated with stroke severity on admission and functional outcomes at 3 months. ω3-PUFAs are potential blood biomarkers for prognosis of acute non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke patients.,closed_qa
Do research bronchoscopies adversely affect HIV-infected individuals ' future health-care decisions?,"Asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals are increasingly recruited for studies involving invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy. We sought to determine the response to and outcome of a request for a research bronchoscopy in HIV-positive individuals with no respiratory disease, and whether this would adversely affect future decisions to have a medically indicated bronchoscopy. Prospective, semistructured, questionnaire-based study in a London teaching hospital HIV outpatient clinic. One hundred and seven consecutive HIV-infected eligible individuals. Thirty-one healthy volunteers served as a control group for the subjective response to bronchoscopy. Subjects' attitudes and responses to requests for bronchoscopy and subsequent behavior when they required medically indicated bronchoscopy. Seventy-five patients (70%) agreed to the procedure in principle, predominantly for altruistic reasons. Thirty-nine subjects underwent bronchoscopy. Five percent found it worse than expected; and 79% agreed to another research bronchoscopy (performed in 11 subjects approximately 2 years later). All patients said they would undergo bronchoscopy again for diagnostic purposes (required in seven during the study). When compared to a healthy volunteer population within the same study, postbronchoscopy symptoms were similar in frequency although somewhat different in nature. Subjects felt that a clear explanation of what was involved enhanced their participation in this research.",Invasive research procedures such as bronchoscopy can be performed and are repeatable in a healthy HIV-infected population. Performance of procedures for research purposes does not appear to adversely affect future health-care decisions.,closed_qa
Is nonfunctional SCN1A common in severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy?,"Mutations in SCN1A, encoding the human Na(V)1.1 neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel, cause the syndrome of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI). Most SMEI-associated mutations are predicted to truncate the SCN1A protein, likely causing a loss of sodium channel function. However, many missense or in-frame deletion SCN1A mutations have also been reported in this disorder, but their functional impact is largely unknown. Here we report the functional characterization of eight SCN1A mutations (G177E, I227S, R393H, Y426N, H939Q, C959R, delF1289, and T1909I) previously identified in SMEI probands. SCN1A mutants were constructed in a recombinant human SCN1A and then heterologously expressed in human tsA201 cells along with the human beta(1) and beta(2) sodium channel accessory subunits. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was used to define biophysical properties of each mutant and for comparison with the wild-type (WT) channel. Six of the mutants were nonfunctional, but Y426N and T1909I generated measurable sodium channel activity. Cells expressing Y426N and T1909I had significantly lower current densities compared with WT-SCN1A. In addition, other biophysical abnormalities were observed for the two functional mutants including decreased channel availability (Y426N) and increased persistent sodium current (T1909I).","We conclude that SMEI is caused either by complete loss of SCN1A function, or by dysfunctional sodium channels exhibiting mixed biophysical properties. This wide spectrum of functional defects observed among SCN1A mutations suggests that SMEI may result from more than a single molecular or cellular mechanism, or require other factors for pathogenesis.",closed_qa
Does insulin improve functional and metabolic recovery of reperfused working rat heart?,"Glucose, insulin, and potassium solution improves left ventricular function in refractory pump failure. Direct effects of insulin on the heart cannot be determined in vivo. We hypothesized that insulin has a direct positive inotropic effect on the reperfused heart. Isolated working rat hearts were perfused with buffer containing glucose (5 mmol/L) plus oleate (1.2 mmol/L). Hearts were subjected to 15 minutes of ischemia and reperfused with or without insulin (100 microU/mL) for 40 minutes. Epinephrine (1 micromol/L) was added for the last 20 minutes. Hearts recovered 51.1% of preischemic cardiac power in the absence and 76.4% in the presence of insulin (p < 0.05). Whereas oleate oxidation remained unchanged, glucose uptake and oxidation increased during reperfusion with epinephrine (p < 0.01). This increase was significantly greater when hearts were reperfused in the presence of insulin (p < 0.01). Insulin also prevented an epinephrine-induced glycogen breakdown during reperfusion (p < 0.05).",Insulin has a direct positive inotropic effect on postischemic rat heart. This effect is additive to epinephrine and occurs without delay. Increased rates of glucose oxidation and net glycogen synthesis are more protracted.,closed_qa
Are older pedestrians allowed enough time to cross intersections safely?,"To describe the pedestrian traffic flow at a busy urban intersection and determine the percentage of older pedestrians at risk for injury as a result of reduced walking speeds. Observational study. The intersection of Third Street and Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, California. All pedestrians who started to cross the intersection during the legally acceptable parts of the traffic cycle during three days of observation (n = 1229) and a subsequent sample of 100 consecutive younger and 100 consecutive older crossers. The ability of all subjects to cross the intersection in the allotted time was measured. A questionnaire was administered to pedestrians who were unable to cross the intersection in time. In addition, we measured the actual gait speed of a subsequent consecutive sample of 100 younger and 100 older pedestrians. Of the 592 older pedestrians observed, 27% were unable to reach the opposite curb before the light changed to allow cross traffic to enter the intersection, and one-fourth of this group were stranded by at least a full traffic lane away from safety. All younger pedestrians were able to cross in the allotted time. Older pedestrians took significantly longer than younger pedestrians to cross the street (P<0.0001). The mean walking velocity +/- 1 SD for older and younger pedestrians was 0.86 +/- 0.17 and 1.27 +/- 0.17 m per second, respectively. Fifty-three percent of those older pedestrians unable to cross in time were willing to be surveyed. Mean age was 77 years, 74% considered the intersection to be ""dangerous"", and 63% stated they cross the street at least once daily. City traffic reports revealed that over the preceding 5 years about one older pedestrian per year had been hit in this intersection, and 165 such injuries had occurred city-wide per year.",The timing of this pedestrian signal does not allow adequate time for many older pedestrians to cross and puts them at potential risk. Providing more crossing time may reduce pedestrian injuries and allow for an increased feeling of independence and confidence by older citizens.,closed_qa
Do bacillus subtilis spore film dosimeters in personal dosimetry for occupational solar ultraviolet exposure?,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is noted to be one of the most important risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers. The recent development of a spore film test chamber containing spores of Bacillus subtilis resulted in a new method of UV measurement with a spectral sensitivity profile similar to erythema-weighted data calculated from spectroradiometric measurements. The practical application of dosimeters was tested on 11 persons for 43 days, under different conditions of UV exposure in five different geographical regions. Four professional lifeguards at a public swimming pool carried dosimeters attached to their shoulders or to their caps, for 11 days. Three mountain guides attached dosimeters laterally to their heads on 27 different occasions of mountaineering activity in different mountain regions. Four ski instructors carried lateral head dosimeters during eight days of skiing in the Alps. The life guards received daily UV exposures ranging from 3.6 to 9.5 minimal erythema doses (MED) (mean 5.9, SD +/- 1.9). The mountain guides had personal daily UV exposures of from 4.4 to 17.1 MED (11.9 +/- 3.9) and ski instructors from 2.8 to 8.8 MED (6.1 +/- 1.8).",Bacillus subtilis spore film dosimeters can be applied effectively for personal solar UV measurements of occupationally exposed persons. such as lifeguards. mountain guides and ski instructors.

Do size of submicrometric and nanometric particles affect cellular uptake and biological activity of macrophages in vitro?,"Micrometric and nanometric particles are increasingly used in different fields and may exhibit variable toxicity levels depending on their physicochemical characteristics. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the size parameter on cellular uptake and biological activity, working with well-characterized fluorescent particles. We focused our attention on macrophages, the main target cells of the respiratory system responsible for the phagocytosis of the particles. FITC fluorescent silica particles of variable submicronic sizes (850, 500, 250 and 150 nm) but with similar surface coating (COOH) were tailored and physico-chemically characterized. These particles were then incubated with the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. After microscopic observations (SEM, TEM, confocal), a quantitative evaluation of the uptake was carried out. Fluorescence detected after a quenching with trypan blue allows us to distinguish and quantify entirely engulfed fluorescent particles from those just adhering to the cell membrane. Finally, these data were compared to the in vitro toxicity assessed in terms of cell damage, inflammation and oxidative stress (evaluated by LDH release, TNF-α and ROS production respectively).","Particles were well characterized (fluorescence, size distribution, zeta potential, agglomeration and surface groups) and easily visualized after cellular uptake using confocal and electron microscopy. The number of internalized particles was precisely evaluated. Size was found to be an important parameter regarding particles uptake and in vitro toxicity but this latter strongly depends on the particles doses employed.",closed_qa
Is down-regulation of CD9 expression during prostate carcinoma progression associated with CD9 mRNA modifications?,"Cluster-of-differentiation antigen 9 (CD9) protein, a member of the tetraspanin family, has been implicated in carcinogenesis of various human tumors. Although decreased expression of the CD82 tetraspanin protein, a close CD9 relative, is associated with prostate cancer progression, CD9 expression has not been analyzed in this malignancy. CD9 expression in human prostatic adenocarcinoma was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on 167 primary tumors and 88 lymph node or bone metastases. CD9 cDNA was sequenced from two human prostate cancer cell lines, prostatic adenocarcinoma, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and normal prostatic tissues. Although CD9 was detected in the epithelium of normal prostatic tissues, reduced or loss of CD9 expression within neoplastic cells was observed in 24% of 107 clinically localized primary adenocarcinomas, 85% of 60 clinically advanced primary adenocarcinomas, 85% of 65 lymph node metastases, and 65% of 23 bone metastases. Difference in CD9 expression between clinically localized and advanced diseases was highly significant (P < 1 x 10(-7)). Whereas there was no alteration of CD9 cDNA in normal tissues, all PC-3-derived cell lines, one PIN, and four prostatic adenocarcinomas harbored deletions in their CD9 cDNAs. Recurring CD9 point mutations were also found in PC-3M-LN4 cells, one PIN, and seven prostatic adenocarcinomas.","CD9 expression is significantly reduced and even lost during prostate cancer progression. Moreover, deletions and mutations of the CD9 mRNA may be associated with loss of protein expression observed in tumor cells. Our data suggest that CD9 inactivation may play an important role in prostate cancer progression.",closed_qa
Are celecoxib and Diclofenac Plus Omeprazole Similarly Effective in the Treatment of Arthritis in Patients at High GI Risk in the CONDOR Trial?,"Compare effectiveness of celecoxib versus diclofenac plus omeprazole in improving arthritis signs and symptoms in patients at high gastrointestinal (GI) risk who were enrolled in the CONDOR (Celecoxib vs Omeprazole and Diclofenac in Patients With Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis) trial. CONDOR was a 6-month, prospective, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group, randomized, multicenter trial comparing celecoxib 200 mg twice daily versus diclofenac slow release (SR) 75 mg twice daily plus omeprazole 20 mg daily. Patients were Helicobacter pylori negative, had osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were aged ≥60 years, were with or without a history of gastroduodenal ulceration, or were ≥18 years with previous gastroduodenal ulceration. Patients' Global Assessment of Arthritis was determined at each study visit. A total of 4484 patients were randomized to treatment (2238 celecoxib, 2246 diclofenac SR) and included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Least squares mean (LSM) (standard error [SE]) for Patients' Global Assessment of Arthritis was 3.219 (0.017) and 3.221 (0.017) at baseline for celecoxib and diclofenac SR (p=0.90).

Does penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose ameliorate inflammation by inhibiting MyD88/NF-κB and MyD88/MAPK signalling pathways?,"The gallnut of Rhus chinensis MILL and its main constituent penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (PGG) inhibited NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated peritoneal and colonic macrophages. Here we have investigated PGG mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory effects of PGG in vitro and in vivo. Male C57BL/6 mice (18-22 g, 6 weeks old) were used to prepare peritoneal and colonic macrophages and for the induction of colitis by intrarectal administration of 2,3,4-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS). A range of inflammatory markers and transcription factors were evaluated by elisa, immunoblotting, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to TLR-4 in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages was not affected by PGG. However PGG inhibited binding of an anti-MyD88 antibody to peritoneal macrophages, but did not reduce binding of anti-IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) and IRAK4 antibodies to the macrophages with or without transfection with MyD88 siRNA. PGG potently reduced the activation of IRAK1, NF-κB, and MAPKs in LPS- or pepetidoglycan-stimulated peritoneal and colonic macrophages. PGG suppressed IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, while increasing expression of the anti-inflammatorycytokine IL-10. Oral administration of PGG inhibited colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice with TNBS-induced colitis, along with reducing NF-κB activation and IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels, whereas it increased IL-10.",PGG reduced activation of NF-κB and MAPK signalling pathways by directly interacting with the MyD88 adaptor protein.

Does gadd45b mediate Electroconvulsive Shock Induced Proliferation of Hippocampal Neural Stem Cells?,"Electroconvulsive shock (ECS), also known as an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is an effective and safe treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders including pharmacoresistant major depressive disorder.

The present study aims to delineate the role of Gadd45b in mediating proliferation of neural stem cell types including quiescent radial glia-like (RGL) and amplifying non-radial glia-like (non-RGL) neural precursors following ECS. RGL and non-RGL neural stem cell populations defined by co-localization of MCM2+ and nestin+ cells and morphologically by the presence of radial processes were stereologically analyzed.

Robbing Peter to pay Paul: did New York State's outpatient commitment program crowd out voluntary service recipients?,"This study examined whether New York State's assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) program disadvantaged voluntary service recipients by directing services toward court-ordered individuals. Administrative data from the New York State Office of Mental Health were linked with Medicaid claims from 1999 through 2007 to compare trends in utilization of enhanced outpatient services by involuntary and voluntary service recipients with serious mental illness. Multivariable time series analysis was used to examine the likelihood that voluntary care seekers (N=3,295) either did not initiate or did not receive assertive community treatment or intensive case management during any month as a function of the number of AOT orders in the system. New York State appropriated new resources for enhanced community-based mental health services to implement AOT. During the first three years of the AOT program, most of the expansion in enhanced services was directed toward individuals under court-ordered treatment, which appears to have affected voluntary care seekers by lowering their odds of initiating enhanced services and raising their odds of having these services discontinued or no longer receiving them. However, after the first three years of AOT, enhanced service provision expanded steadily among both voluntary and involuntary recipients.","In tandem with New York's AOT program, enhanced services increased among involuntary recipients, whereas no corresponding increase was initially seen for voluntary recipients. In the long run, however, overall service capacity was increased, and the focus on enhanced services for AOT participants appears to have led to greater access to enhanced services for both voluntary and involuntary recipients.",closed_qa
Does copeptin add diagnostic information to high-sensitivity troponin T in low- to intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain : results from the rule out myocardial infarction by computed tomography ( ROMICAT ) study?,"Copeptin, a stable peptide derived from the AVP precursor, has been linked to presence and severity of myocardial ischemia. We sought to evaluate the predictive value of copeptin and its incremental value beyond that of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in patients with acute chest pain and low to intermediate risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We recruited patients who presented with acute chest pain to the emergency department and had a negative initial conventional troponin T test (<0.03 μg/L). In all patients, hs-cTnT and copeptin measurements were taken. Each patient also underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT) and coronary angiography. Baseline copeptin concentrations, in contrast to hs-cTnT, were not significantly higher in patients with ACS than in those without (P = 0.24). hs-cTnT showed an earlier rise in patients with ACS than copeptin, when analyses were stratified by time. A copeptin concentration ≥7.38 pmol/L had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% and a sensitivity of 51%, whereas hs-cTnT (≥13.0 pg/mL) had a NPV of 96% and a sensitivity of 63%. The combination of copeptin and hs-cTnT resulted in a lower diagnostic accuracy than hs-cTnT alone. Finally, on cardiac CT, copeptin concentrations were not associated with coronary artery morphology, although they were related to the presence of left ventricular dysfunction (P = 0.02).","Among patients with acute chest pain and low to intermediate risk for ACS, copeptin concentrations are not independently predictive of ACS and do not add diagnostic value beyond that of hs-cTnT measurements.",closed_qa
Are high serum CA19-9 levels associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with intrahepatic duct stones : a case-control study?,"Hepatolithiasis is a known risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Due to the high risk of complications that accompany endoscopic and surgical stone removal, it is often difficult to decide whether it is beneficial to remove intrahepatic ductal stones. We conducted a case-control study to determine the risk of developing CC and the benefit of stone removal in patients with hepatolithiasis. Twenty-three patients with CC group between 2002 and 2012 were included in this study. For each patient with CC, four control patients with hepatolithiasis were enrolled based on age and sex matching. Finally, 115 patients with hepatolithiasis were enrolled. The mean length of time that intrahepatic stones were present was 116.57 (± 98.77) months in the CC group and 80.56 (± 101.10) months in the control group. History of gastrectomy [OR 5.756 (1.329-24.930), p = 0.019], history of choledochoenterostomy (OR 4.938 [1.129-21.595], p = 0.034), serum CA19-9 level [OR 1.001 (1.000-1.001), p = 0.022], and complete removal of stones [OR 0.167 (0.052-0.539), p = 0.003] were independent predictive factors of CC. In patients who had undergone incomplete removal of stones, the occurrence of CC was significantly reduced overall as well as in a subgroup of patients with elevated CA19-9 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.006, respectively) compared to patients with a CA19-9 of <22 U/mL (p = 0.477).","History of gastrectomy or choledochoenterostomy, high levels of serum CA19-9, and incomplete removal of stones were potential predictive factors of CC in patients with hepatolithiasis.

Does silent ischemic lesion recurrence on magnetic resonance imaging predict subsequent clinical vascular events?,"Previous studies identified a high frequency of silent ischemic lesion recurrence on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after an index stroke. To investigate whether ischemic lesion recurrence on MRI predicts subsequent clinical events. Retrospective cohort study. General community hospital. Patients We recruited 120 patients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke (IS) and who underwent initial MRI within 24 hours of onset and subsequent MRI on day 5. Of those patients, 68 underwent follow-up MRI up to 90 days after onset. Early silent lesion recurrence was defined as new asymptomatic ischemic lesions on 5-day MRI, and late silent lesion recurrence was defined as those on 30- or 90-day MRI. Patients were followed up for recurrent vascular events by interviews. Among the 104 patients (86.7%) who had available clinical outcome data, 35 (33.7%) had early silent lesion recurrence; 15 (22.1%) of 68 patients had late silent lesion recurrence. Of the patients, 8 experienced a recurrent IS, 3 experienced a transient ischemic attack, and 3 had vascular deaths during a mean +/- SD follow-up of 19.3 +/- 9.0 months. For recurrent IS as a clinical end point, late silent lesion recurrence independently predicted recurrent IS (odds ratio, 6.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-39.55) by the Cox proportional hazards model. For combined clinical end points, early (odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-10.00) and late (odds ratio, 8.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-50.91) silent lesion recurrences independently predicted clinical recurrent IS, transient ischemic attack, or vascular deaths.",These data suggest that silent ischemic lesion recurrence on MRI may be a potential surrogate marker of clinical recurrence.,closed_qa
Does metabolomics analysis of umbilical cord blood clarify changes in saccharides associated with delivery method?,"A metabolomic approach using umbilical cord blood from infants at birth has not been studied widely yet. We examined changes in metabolite levels in umbilical cord blood at birth via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolomics, with the aim of achieving a detailed understanding of fetal stress during labor. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kobe University School of Medicine. This was a cohort study of pregnant women based in Palmore Hospital, which is located in an urban area of Japan, and was carried out between December 2010 and May 2011. Umbilical cord arterial blood samples were obtained from 41 infants immediately after delivery. Metabolites in the blood samples were measured using GC/MS to investigate whether the delivery method (spontaneous onset of labor, induction of labor or elective cesarean section) affected the metabolite profile in umbilical cord blood. Elective cesarean section without labor led to lower levels of isoleucine, fructose, mannose, glucose, allose, glucuronic acid, inositol and cysteine in comparison with vaginal delivery following spontaneous labor and without medication.","It is proposed that the stress associated with labor be involved in alterations in the levels of metabolites, particularly saccharides such as glucose, in umbilical cord blood.",closed_qa
Seems high-risk human papillomavirus involved in DES-related and of limited importance in nonDES related clear-cell carcinoma of the cervix?,"Over 90% of all cervical adenocarcinoma are caused by a transforming infection with a high-risk type human papillomavirus (hrHPV). Previous studies demonstrated that the association between hrHPV positivity and cervical clear-cell adenocarcinoma (CCAC) varies between 0% and 100%.

Representative slides of 28 women diagnosed with CCAC were tested for hrHPV by two PCR methods (the clinically validated GP5+/6+ PCR and the very sensitive SPF(10)PCR/LiPA(25)). Fifteen women were DES-exposed, 10 unexposed and of 3 women DES-exposure was unknown. Twenty-one cases with sufficient material were immuno-histochemically stained for p16INK4a and p53. Seven tumors, of which four DES-exposed and two unexposed tested positive for hrHPV with GP5+/6+ PCR. Thirteen tumors, of which five DES-exposed and seven unexposed, tested positive with SPF(10)PCR/LiPA(25). In one women with unknown exposure, a CCAC tested positive in both assays. Only three cases, none in DES-exposed women, and all positive with both hrHPV assays, revealed diffuse p16INK4a immuno-staining and weak p53 staining as well, supporting indisputable hrHPV involvement.","Although the prevalence of hrHPV was high, only two DES-unrelated CCAC (25%) and one tumor in a woman with unknown exposure could be attributed to hrHPV.",closed_qa
Does thyroxine therapy ameliorate serum levels of eicosanoids in Chinese subclinical hypothyroidism patients?,"The eicosanoids derived from phospholipids play key roles in inflammation. However, the profiles of serum eicosanoids in subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) patients and the effects of thyroxine replacement therapy (TRT) on these eicosanoids remain unclear.

The serum levels of cPLA2, eicosanoids (8-isoPGF2a, 11-dehydroTXB2 and 12-HETE) and 11-dehydroTXB2/6-Keto-PGF1a were significantly elevated in SH patients. The serum TSH levels were significantly correlated with the levels of cPLA2 (r=+0.65), 11-dehydroTXB2 (r=+0.32) and 11-dehydroTXB2/6-Keto-PGF1a (r=+0.37). After 3-month TRT, the serum levels of TSH, cPLA2 and the above-mentioned eicosanoids in SH patients were significantly decreased.","The metabolism of eicosanoids is significantly altered in Chinese SH patients, and TRT can ameliorate the abnormalities of serum eicosanoid levels.",closed_qa
Does microRNA-181a suppress salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma metastasis by targeting MAPK-Snai2 pathway?,"To date microRNAs and their contribution to the onset and propagation of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) are limited. The objective of this study was to identify miR-181a and its mechanism in the metastasis of SACC. At first microarray and quantitative RT-PCR were used to investigate microRNA profiles and miR-181a in paired SACC cell lines with different metastatic potential. Then the effect of miR-181a on metastatic potential of SACC was investigated. MiR-181a target genes and Snai2 promoter activity were investigated using luciferase reporter gene assays. Western blot was used to detect MAPK-Snai2 pathway-related protein level. A panel of deregulated microRNAs (including miR-181a) was identified in paired of SACC cell lines. Functional analysis indicated that miR-181a inhibited SACC cell migration, invasion and proliferation in vitro, and it suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Direct targeting of miR-181a to MAP2K1, MAPK1 and Snai2 was confirmed by luciferase reporter gene assays. MiR-181a mimic inhibited the expression of MAP2K1, MAPK1 and Snai2 in SACC cells. MAP2K1 or MAPK1 siRNA suppressed Snai2 gene promoter activity and reduced Snai2 expression and the metastatic potential of SACC cells.","Our results indicate that miR-181a plays an important role in the metastasis of SACC, and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for SACC. MiR-181a regulates the MAPK-Snai2 pathway both through direct cis-regulatory mechanism and through indirect trans-regulatory mechanism.",closed_qa
Does mechanical stress enhance serotonin 2B receptor modulating brain natriuretic peptide through nuclear factor-kappaB in cardiomyocytes?,"Serotonin via serotonin 2B receptors (SR2BR) regulates cardiac embryonic development and adult heart functions. However, the role of SR2BR in the failing heart due to pressure overload is not well understood. Wistar rats of aortic banding and neonatal cardiomyocyte with mechanical stretch were used as cardiomyopathy models. After two weeks of aortic banding surgery, serum serotonin, mRNA and protein expression of SR2BR increased significantly. The selective SR2BR antagonist, SB215505 (SB), significantly reduced the increase in heart weight, decreased heart wall thickness, left ventricular mass and the expression of the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) but did not attenuate the up-regulation of SR2BR protein expression in rats after aortic banding for three weeks. After following in vitro mechanical stretch of cardiomyocytes and incubation with serotonin 1 muM, the level of SR2BR and BNP protein increased time-dependently. When transfected by specific siRNA of SR2BR or pretreated with caffeic acid phenethyl ester in cardiomyocytes, the increase of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation and BNP protein induced by serotonin incubation plus mechanical stretch were both reversed.",SR2BR expression is involved in pressure-induced cardiomyopathy and its downstream signaling may involve NF-kappaB to modulate BNP expression in cardiomyocyte.,closed_qa
Can the health system deliver?,"Following a protracted civil war, Liberia is rebuilding its health system. One of the aims of reconstruction is to expand access to health care to a previously underserved rural population. This study analysed the determinants of Liberians' confidence in their ability to obtain needed care for themselves or their children in case of serious illness. A cross-sectional survey of 1435 adults in Nimba County, Liberia was conducted. Logistic regression models were estimated with reported ability to obtain needed health services for serious illness as the dependent variable, and demographics, health need, health system characteristics and informal health care as independent variables. Overall, 50.56% of respondents reported that they could obtain needed services for themselves or their children. Confidence in the ability to obtain care increased with education [odds ratio (OR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-2.21]and poor physical health in the past 30 days (OR 1.38, 95% CI: 1.01-1.88), and decreased with poverty (OR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.93), exposure to previous trauma (OR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.36-0.71), dissatisfaction with respondent's last formal health visit (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.91) and high utilization of the informal health sector (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.96). No correlation was found between health system confidence and being female, being 35 years old or younger, formal health sector use, being within an hour of a clinic and the closest clinic having basic capabilities.","Respondents' experiences with the health care system had a greater correlation with their confidence in obtaining needed health care than proximity or quality of medical equipment in health clinics. Despite pro-poor policies guiding health system reconstruction, poor and less educated individuals have less confidence that the health system can meet their health needs.",closed_qa
Does the Paf1 complex promote displacement of histones upon rapid induction of transcription by RNA polymerase II?,"The yeast Paf1 protein complex is required for efficient transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), but the precise role of the complex has been unclear. Here we show that depletion of the Ctr9 or Paf1 component of the Paf1 complex delays the loss of histones from the GAL1 gene upon induction. This delay in histone removal is accompanied by a decrease in association of RNA pol II with GAL1 and altered distribution of the polymerase along the locus.","These observations may explain why initial induction of GAL transcripts is reduced in Ctr9- or Paf1-deficient cells, and is consistent with a model suggesting that the Paf1 complex and the histone modifications that it mediates increase efficiency of transcriptional elongation by promoting nucleosomal destabilization and histone removal.",closed_qa
Does nitric oxide inhibit Kv4.3 and human cardiac transient outward potassium current ( Ito1 )?,"Chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF) is characterized by a shortening of the plateau phase of the action potentials (AP) and a decrease in the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we analysed the effects of NO on Kv4.3 (I(Kv4.3)) and on human transient outward K(+) (I(to1)) currents as well as the signalling pathways responsible for them. We also analysed the expression of NO synthase 3 (NOS3) in patients with CAF. I(Kv4.3) and I(to1) currents were recorded in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in human atrial and mouse ventricular dissociated myocytes using the whole-cell patch clamp. The expression of NOS3 was analysed by western blotting. AP were recorded using conventional microelectrode techniques in mouse atrial preparations. NO and NO donors inhibited I(Kv4.3) and human I(to1) in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner (IC(50) for NO: 375.0 +/- 48 nM) as a consequence of the activation of adenylate cyclase and the subsequent activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the serine-threonine phosphatase 2A. The density of the I(to1) recorded in ventricular myocytes from wild-type (WT) and NOS3-deficient mice (NOS3(-/-)) was not significantly different. Furthermore, the duration of atrial AP repolarization in WT and NOS3(-/-) mice was not different. The increase in NO levels to 200 nM prolonged the plateau phase of the mouse atrial AP and lengthened the AP duration measured at 20 and 50% of repolarization of the human atrial CAF-remodelled AP as determined using a mathematical model. However, the expression of NOS3 was not modified in left atrial appendages from CAF patients.",Our results suggested that the increase in the atrial NO bioavailability could partially restore the duration of the plateau phase of CAF-remodelled AP by inhibiting the I(to1) as a result of the activation of non-canonical enzymatic pathways.,closed_qa
Does [ Comparative assessment of cryosurgical treatment result in allergic and non-allergic rhinitis ]?,"The aim of the work was to assess the treatment efficiency in patients with allergic and non-allergic vasomotor rhinitis after cryoablation procedures. The study covered 60 patients, including 32 women and 28 men, aged 18-66. The patients were divided into two groups: I - 30 patients with chronic allergic rhinitis, II - 30 patients with non-allergic vasomotor rhinitis. The study methodology involved: an otorhinolaryngological interview with a questionnaire and an allergological interview, an objective otolaryngological and rhinomanometrical examination with Homoth apparatus, a subjective evaluation questionnaire for nasal blockage intensification (the scale ranging from 0 to 10), skin tests to aeorallergens and food allergens (Allergopharma Co.), nasal endoscopy with a straight rigid Eleps endoscope before the treatment and 3 months following it. The cryoablation of nasal conchas was performed under local infiltration anesthesia (1% Xylokaina solution) using the Cryo-S apparatus from CryoFlex Poland Company and a flat probe in a spatula shape (L-50) that was placed on the outer surfaces of the inferior nasal concha. The inferior nasal concha cryoablation resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the subjective assessment scale in group I by 82.6% and group II by 141.2%. In the endoscopic examination 3 months following the cryoablation a good nasal patency was achieved in 63.3% patients from group I and 76.7% patients from group II. The conducted studies show a better nasal passages patency in patients with non-allergic rhinitis than in those with allergic rhinitis.","Cryoablation procedures on the inferior nasal conchas are not the primary therapy, but together with other methods they can immensely improve the life comfort of a rhinitis patient.",closed_qa
Does the tumor-suppressor gene LZTS1 suppress hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation by impairing PI3K/Akt pathway?,"To study the role of LZTS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and the molecular mechanism involved. LZTS1 expression was studied in 10 HCC cell lines and 1 normal hepatocyte cell line by western blot analysis and qRT-PCR. One HCC cell line was selected and transfected with LZTS1 lentivirus. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were then determined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. LZTS1, cyclin D1, CDK1, Cdc25C, pS473 Akt, and pT308 Akt mRNA and protein expressions were measured. PS473 Akt and pT308 Akt expression level was also compared with the HCC cells treated with LY294002. Compared with the normal hepatocyte cells, LZTS1 expression in HCC cells was significantly lower. After the transfection with LZTS1 lentivirus, HCC cell proliferation ability decreased markedly and HCC cells were blocked at G2/M phase. Cyclin D1 and CDK1 expression were both decreased but not significantly. Cdc25C expression was increased significantly. PS473 Akt and pT308 Akt expression level was increased significantly as well, which were almost the same with those transfected with LY294002.",LZTS1 could inhibit HCC cell proliferation by impairing PI3K/Akt pathway.,closed_qa
"Is gleason pattern 5 the strongest pathologic predictor of recurrence , metastasis , and prostate cancer-specific death in patients receiving salvage radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy?","The presence of Gleason pattern 5 (GP5) at radical prostatectomy (RP) has been associated with worse clinical outcome; however, this pathologic variable has not been assessed in patients receiving salvage radiation therapy (SRT) after a rising prostate-specific antigen level. A total of 575 patients who underwent primary RP for localized prostate cancer and subsequently received SRT at a tertiary medical institution were reviewed retrospectively. Primary outcomes of interest were biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), which were assessed via univariate analysis and Fine and Grays competing risks multivariate models. On pathologic evaluation, 563 (98%) patients had a documented Gleason score (GS). The median follow-up post-SRT was 56.7 months. A total of 60 (10.7%) patients had primary, secondary, or tertiary GP5. On univariate analysis, the presence of GP5 was prognostic for BF (hazard ratio [HR] 3.3; P < .0001), DM (HR:11.1, P < .0001), and PCSM (HR:8.8, P < .0001). Restratification of the Gleason score to include GP5 as a distinct entity resulted in improved prognostic capability. Patients with GP5 had clinically worse outcomes than patients with GS8(4+4). On multivariate analysis, the presence of GP5 was the most adverse pathologic predictor of BF (HR 2.9; P < .0001), DM (HR 14.8; P < .0001), and PCSM (HR 5.7; P < .0001).","In the setting of SRT for prostate cancer, the presence of GP5 is a critical pathologic predictor of BF, DM, and PCSM.

Do clinical characteristics of treatment-seeking adolescents with opioid versus cannabis/alcohol use disorders?,"To assess the clinical characteristics of adolescents with DSM-IV opioid use disorder (OUD) and compare them to adolescents with cannabis/alcohol use disorders. 94 adolescents (ages 14-18 years) with a current OUD and 74 adolescents with a current non-OUD cannabis/alcohol use disorders were recruited from admissions, predominantly residential, to a substance abuse treatment program in Baltimore, ML. Participants were assessed cross-sectionally using standardized interviews and self-reports. Chi-square, t-tests and ANCOVA (adjusting for age, gender and treatment setting, race and residence) were performed to determine group differences on demographic, substance use, psychiatric and HIV-risk behaviors; logistic regression analyses, both unadjusted and adjusted for the above five factors were conducted to assess the strength of associations. The OUD group was more likely to be Caucasian, to have dropped out of school and to live in the suburbs (trend). They also had greater substance use severity with higher proportion of current sedative and multiple substance use disorders (SUD). There were generally no differences in rates of criminal behaviors. Both groups had high rates of current psychiatric disorders (83% vs. 78%, n.s.) but the OUD adolescents reported higher depressive symptoms, mostly in the moderate range. Injection drug use (IDU) and needle sharing was almost exclusive to the OUD group, while both groups reported similar high rates of risky sexual behaviors.","While there were similarities between the two groups, OUD adolescents evidenced greater impairment in academic, substance use, depressive symptom and IDU-related HIV-risk areas. Findings suggest poorer long-term prognosis and highlight the need for specialized interventions for treatment-seeking OUD adolescents.",closed_qa
Is soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 associated with diminished estimated glomerular filtration rate in colombian patients with type 2 diabetes?,"The tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) family of inflammatory molecules plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) complications. TNF-α soluble receptors 1 (sTNFR1) and 2 (sTNFR2) have been associated with chronic kidney disease in DM2 patients. This cross-sectional study intended to determine serum concentrations of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 in Colombian patients and correlated them with various clinical variables, especially kidney function. 92 Colombian patients with DM2 were recruited. Anthropometric variables, glycemic control parameters, lipid profile and renal function were assessed for each patient. Levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were determined using ELISA. Patients were stratified in two groups according to reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<60ml/min/1.73m(2)) and normal eGFR (≥60ml/min/1.73m(2)). Significantly elevated levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were observed in the diminished versus normal eGFR group. Also, significant differences were noticed between both groups in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, percentage of hypertensive subjects treated with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and subjects treated with metformin. No differences were observed regarding body mass index (BMI), albuminuria and lipid profile. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that sTNFR1 alone showed a significant association with low eGFR (p=0.009). However, after adjusting for age, the association weakens. Moreover, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 showed a linear negative correlation with eGFR (r=-0.448, p<0.001 and r=-0.376, p<0.001, respectively). A positive correlation was also seen between sTNFR1 and HbA1c, whereas a negative correlation between both sTNFRs and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was found.","Elevated levels of sTNFRs, especially sTNFR1, are associated with loss of kidney function in Hispanic patients with DM2.

Is handedness mainly associated with an asymmetry of corticospinal excitability and not of transcallosal inhibition?,"The study aims to compare transcallosal inhibition (TI), as assessed by the paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique, in a sample of right-handed subjects (RH) and left-handed subjects (LH). Motor thresholds (MTs) and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were also measured in the two groups, as an index of corticospinal activity. Thirty-two normal subjects (16 RH and 16 LH) were recorded with a paired-pulse TMS paradigm (intensity of both pulses=120% of MT). The inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 ms for both motor cortices, and MEP responses were recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscles. Both groups showed a clear TI centred around the 12 ms ISI, but no difference was found as a function of handedness or of hemisphere. On the other hand, the two groups differed in terms of corticospinal activity, since the hand motor dominant hemisphere had lower MTs than the non-dominant one in LH, and larger MEP amplitudes for the right hand were found in RH.","Results point to a functional asymmetry of the motor cortex on the hand-dominant versus the non-dominant hemisphere, while handedness does not seem associated with functional differences in callosal inhibition, as measured by the inter-hemispheric paired-pulse TMS technique.",closed_qa
Does dietary restriction interfere with oxidative status and intrinsic intestinal innervation in aging rats?,"To evaluate the effects of dietary restriction on oxidative status, the HuC/D-neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) myenteric neuron population, HuC/D-S100 glial cells, and the morphometry of the small intestine in rats at various ages. Fifteen Wistar rats were divided into 7-and 12-mo-old control groups and a 12-mo-old experimental group subjected to dietary restrictions (50% of normal ration) for 5 mo. At 7 and 12 mo of age, the animals were anesthetized, and blood was collected to assess the biochemical components and oxidative status. Ileum samples were subjected to double-marker (HuC/D-nNOS and HuC/D-S100) immunostaining and histologic processing to morphometrically analyze intestinal wall elements and determine the metaphase index and rate of caliciform cells. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and the Tukey post hoc test with a 5% significance level. Age affected the oxidative status by increasing lipid peroxidation, with no effect on blood components, intrinsic innervation, and intestinal wall elements. The animals subjected to dietary restriction showed improved levels of total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, and oxidative status, with no changes in the nNOS neuron population. However, the dietary restriction dramatically decreased the glial and HuC/D myenteric populations, led to atrophy of the neuronal cell body, induced glial hypertrophy, and decreased the thickness of the intestinal wall.","The high oxidative status of the aging animals was reversed by dietary restriction, which also lowered cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels. The present dietary restriction elicited morpho-quantitative changes in the myenteric plexus and histology of the ileum, with likely effects on intestinal functions.",closed_qa
Endovascular treatment of diabetic foot in a selected population of patients with below-the-knee disease: is the angiosome model effective?,"To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in a selected population of diabetic patients with below-the-knee (BTK) disease and to analyze the reliability of the angiosome model. We made a retrospective analysis of the results of PTA performed in 201 diabetic patients with BTK-only disease treated at our institute from January 2005 to December 2011. We evaluated the postoperative technical success, and at 1, 6, and 12 months' follow-up, we assessed the rates and values of partial and complete ulcer healing, restenosis, major and minor amputation, limb salvage, and percutaneous oximetry (TcPO2) (Student's t test). We used the angiosome model to compare different clinicolaboratory outcomes in patients treated by direct revascularization (DR) from patients treated with indirect revascularization (IR) technique by Student's t test and the χ(2) test. At a mean ± standard deviation follow-up of 17.5 ± 12 months, we observed a mortality rate of 3.5 %, a major amputation rate of 9.4 %, and a limb salvage rate of 87 % with a statistically significant increase of TcPO2 values at follow-up compared to baseline (p<0.05). In 34 patients, treatment was performed with the IR technique and in 167 by DR; in both groups, there was a statistically significant increase of TcPO2 values at follow-up compared to baseline (p<0.05), without statistically significant differences in therapeutic efficacy.","PTA of the BTK-only disease is a safe and effective option.

Do long-term heavy marijuana users make costly decisions on a gambling task?,"Chronic marijuana use has been associated with impairments of learning, memory, and executive functions. Little is known, however, about the effects of marijuana use on other cognitive domains, such as decision-making, which are thought to play an important role in addiction and drug abuse. The purpose of the present study was to determine if long-term heavy marijuana users employ different decision-making strategies than individuals with minimal marijuana exposure. Volunteers were assigned to a cannabis (n = 10) or control group (n = 10) based upon history of prior marijuana use. Demographic and neuropsychological variables were evaluated, and a decision-making task--the gambling task (GT) was administered. Although few demographic and neuropsychological differences were noted between groups, marijuana users made more decisions that led to larger immediate gains despite more costly losses than controls.","These data suggest that long-term heavy marijuana users may have specific deficits in the ability to balance rewards and punishments that may contribute to continued drug-taking behavior.

Do human Lung Fibroblasts Inhibit Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastasis in Ex Vivo 4D Model?,"We determined the effect of human lung fibroblasts (LFs) in metastatic lesion formation in a four-dimensional (4D) lung cancer model. Human cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from the primary tumor, and normal LFs were isolated from adjacent lung using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The 4D metastatic lung cancer model was seeded with the human lung cancer cell lines (H460, A549, and H1299) alone or was seeded with CAFs or LFs. In addition, the 4D model seeded with human lung cancer cell lines was also treated with conditioned media of LFs or CAFs grown on the 4D model. We determined the number of metastatic tumor cells per high-power field on the model. There were significantly fewer metastatic lesions per high-power field in the 4D model seeded with the H460 cell line and LFs compared with H460 alone on day 15 (p = 0.008) or compared with H460 and CAFs (p = 0.002). This relationship was also seen with A549 and H1299 tumor cells. Moreover, the H460 cell line treated with conditioned media from the 4D model seeded with LFs had significantly fewer metastatic lesions than the 4D model seeded with CAFs. This was also seen with two other pairs of human fibroblasts obtained from patients.","The secreted factor from LFs grown on the 4D model inhibits the formation of metastatic lesions. The 4D model may be used to determine the role of different components of the tumor's microenvironment in metastatic lesion formation, and this secreted factor may provide a novel therapy for treatment of cancer metastasis.",closed_qa
Facial nerve function and hearing preservation acoustic tumor surgery: does the approach matter?,"The retrosigmoid and middle fossa approaches to acoustic tumor excision allow for hearing preservation but differ in the angle of approach to the facial nerve. The authors comparatively examined facial nerve results of each approach. Case series with chart review. Multiple physician subspecialty practice. The authors reviewed facial nerve outcomes of patients undergoing acoustic tumor excision at a single subspecialty practice that had used a hearing preservation approach for the past 15 years. The retrosigmoid and middle fossa approaches were compared. Hearing results and recurrence rates were also examined. One hundred thirty-eight patients had adequate data for inclusion in this study. Of the patients undergoing a middle fossa approach, 80 percent had a House-Brackmann (HB) grade I-II outcome, whereas 90 percent of patients undergoing the retrosigmoid approach had an HB grade I-II. When classifying HB I and II outcomes together, we did not find a statistically different result between the surgical groups. Upon more critical analysis, however, facial function recovered faster and there were more long-term HB grade I function results in the retrosigmoid group. There were more recurrent/residual tumors in the retrosigmoid group and better hearing preservation in the middle fossa group.",There are small but important functional outcome differences between the retrosigmoid and middle fossa approach for acoustic tumors.

High-Frequency (1 kHz) Spinal Cord Stimulation-Is Pulse Shape Crucial for the Efficacy?,"Conflicting data regarding the efficacy of high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (HF SCS) has prompted the issue of the possible importance of the shape of the stimulating pulses. The aim of this pilot study was to compare HF SCS applied with monophasic and biphasic pulses of two different durations with conventional SCS in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Rats were operated with lesions of sciatic nerve branches according to the spared nerve injury procedure (SNI). Animals, which developed pathological tactile hypersensitivity after surgery, were implanted with four-polar miniature SCS leads. SCS was applied during 60 min with either conventional current parameters (monophasic pulse width [PW]: 200 μsec; 50 Hz and amplitude 80% of the motor threshold [MT]), or with high-frequency SCS (1 kHz) with monophasic or biphasic pulses, the latter with pulse widths of either 24 (12 + 12) or 48 (24 + 24) μsec. The outcomes were examined regarding change of tactile hypersensitivity during the one-hour SCS period and with two tests of thermal sensitivity. Conventional monophasic SCS, as well as HF SCS applied with monophasic PW = 24 μsec or with biphasic PW = 48 (24 + 24) μsec, had similar suppressive effects on tactile hypersensitivity. Solely, HF SCS applied with biphasic pulses with a total PW of 24 (12 + 12) μsec demonstrated no effect. Thermal hypersensitivity was unaffected by HF SCS with all pulse varieties.","There is no significant difference in efficacy between HF SCS applied with low amplitude (""subparesthetic"") monophasic and biphasic pulses. However, short PWs providing only 12 μsec of cathodal stimulation was ineffective, presumably because of insufficient electric charge transfer from the lead contacts to the nervous tissue.",closed_qa
Do oxidized LDL Levels Are Increased in HIV Infection and May Drive Monocyte Activation?,"HIV infection is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and this risk correlates with markers of monocyte activation. We have shown that HIV is associated with a prothrombotic monocyte phenotype, which can be partially mitigated by statin therapy. We therefore explored the relationship between oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) particles and monocyte activation. We performed phenotypic analysis of monocytes using flow cytometry on fresh whole blood in 54 patients with HIV and 24 controls without HIV. Plasma levels of oxLDL, soluble CD14, IL-6, and soluble CD163 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vitro experiments were performed using flow cytometry. Plasma levels of oxLDL were significantly increased in HIV infection compared with controls (60.1 units vs. 32.1 units, P < 0.001). Monocyte expression of the oxLDL receptors, CD36 and Toll-like receptor 4, was also increased in HIV. OxLDL levels correlated with markers of monocyte activation, including soluble CD14, tissue factor expression on inflammatory monocytes, and CD36. In vitro stimulation with oxLDL, but not to low-density lipoprotein, resulted in expansion of inflammatory monocytes and increased monocyte expression of tissue factor, recapitulating the monocyte profile we find in HIV disease.","OxLDL may contribute to monocyte activation, and further study in the context of HIV disease is warranted.",closed_qa
Is intradermal influenza vaccination in immunocompromized patients immunogenic and feasible?,"Many strategies, including intradermal vaccination, have been tested to augment antibody responses upon vaccination. This strategy has not been evaluated in different groups of immunocompromized patients. We conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare the humoral response upon standard intramuscular influenza vaccination with the response upon reduced-dose intradermal vaccination in patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients, and healthy controls. In total 156 immunocompromized patients and 41 healthy controls were randomized to receive either 0.5mL of the 2005/2006 trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscular or 0.1mL intradermal. Humoral responses, determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay, were measured before and 28 days postvaccination. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and protection rates (PRs) are reported as primary outcomes, adverse events as a secondary outcome. Reduced-dose intradermal vaccination leads to similar GMTs and PRs, within all tested groups, compared to the standard intramuscular vaccination. Healthy controls yielded significantly better GMTs and PRs than immunocompromized patients. Local skin reactions after intradermal vaccination occurred less frequent and were milder in immunocompromized patients than in healthy subjects and were predictive for a positive vaccination outcome for individual subjects.","Intradermal influenza vaccination is a feasible alternative for standard intramuscular vaccination in several groups of immunocompromized patients, including those treated with anti-TNF, HIV-infected patients and HSCT patients. The occurrence of a local skin reaction after intradermal vaccination is predictive of a response to at least one of the vaccine antigens.",closed_qa
Does microRNA-195 promote apoptosis in mouse podocytes via enhanced caspase activity driven by BCL2 insufficiency?,"The apoptosis of podocytes is a characteristic event in diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether microRNAs (miRNAs) affect podocyte apoptosis in diabetic circumstances. Diabetic nephropathy was induced in DBA/2 mice by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin, and the levels of proteinuria were measured with ELISA. Apoptosis-related miRNAs were screened in isolated glomeruli. A conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line was cultured in 25 mMD-glucose and either transfected with miRNA-195 (miR-195) mimics or inhibitors. The levels of BCL2 and caspase expression were determined using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. We also measured WT-1 and synaptopodin in podocytes. Apoptosis of podocytes was assessed with Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and flow cytometry. The expression of miR-195 was elevated in both diabetic mice with proteinuria and podocytes that were cultured in high glucose. Transfection with miR-195 reduced the protein levels of BCL2 and contributed to podocyte apoptosis via an increase in caspase-3. miR-195-treated podocytes underwent actin rearrangement and failed to synthesize sufficient levels of WT-1 and synaptopodin proteins, which suggests that the cells had suffered injuries similar to those observed in diabetic nephropathy in both humans and animal models.","Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-195 promotes apoptosis of podocytes under high-glucose conditions via enhanced caspase cascades for BCL2 insufficiency. This work thus presents a meaningful approach for deciphering mechanisms, by which miRNAs participate in diabetic renal injury.",closed_qa
Does the extent of resection influence outcome following hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases?,"The acceptable indications for liver resection in patients with colorectal metastases have increased significantly in the last decade. It is thus becoming more difficult to ascertain the limitations for selection as the boundaries have been greatly extended. This has resulted in not only more extensive resections, but more atypical and bilobar resections. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of patients undergoing different extent of liver resection in a specialist unit. All patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal metastases at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh between October 1988 and April 2001 were reviewed. Patients were allocated into one of three groups: standard group, extended group, and segmental group. Patient information was collected from a prospectively completed database. One hundred and thirty-seven patients had liver resections for colorectal metastases during the study period. There were 69 standard hepatectomies, 41 extended resections and 27 segmental resections. CEA level was significantly lower in the segmental group(p = 0.012). There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of median operating time (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test), operative blood loss (p = 0.006, Kruskal-Wallis test) and post-operative stay ( p = 0.036, Kruskal-Wallis test). Major post-operative complications were similar between standard and extended resections but less following segmental resection (p = 0.050. Predicted median survival was 51 months following standard resection, 23 months following extended resection and 59 months after segmental resection ( p = 0.037, log rank test), however, there was no difference between the three groups for actual 5-year survival (p = 0.662, Pearson chi-square test).","Morbidity and mortality rates were comparable with other previous studies as was overall survival, although survival in patients undergoing extended resections was reduced. There was an acceptable level of morbidity and mortality for all three groups. Patients undergoing segmental resection had fewer complications, shorter length of stay, and the longest median survival suggesting adequate oncological clearance. Segmental resection has a role for favourably placed tumour deposits if oncological clearance can be ensured. Extended liver resections have a role for selected patients with bilobar colorectal metastases or large solitary deposits close to the hepatic vein confluence.",closed_qa
Does ginsenoside Rg3 improve erectile function in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats?,"Ginsenoside Rg3 is one of the active ingredients isolated from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer. Previous studies demonstrated that Rg3 has antioxidant and neuroprotective abilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Rg3 on erectile function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Two-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rats received a one-time intraperitoneal (IP) STZ (60 mg/kg) or vehicle injection after a 16-hour fast. Three days later, rats were randomly divided into four groups and were treated with daily gavage feedings of a mix of distilled saline water and 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose or Rg3 dissolved in the mix at doses of 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg for 3 months. A sham group underwent IP injection of saline followed by daily gavage of the above mix for 3 months. Erectile function was assessed by cavernosal nerve electrostimulation at 3 months. The penis was then harvested and deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed. Western blot was performed to examine cleaved caspase-3, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1, and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Neural regeneration was measured by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase staining. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected by colorimetry. In the negative control group, the functional evaluation showed a lower mean intracavernosal pressure (ICP) with cavernosal nerve stimulation than in the sham group; there was a significant change in the expression of cleaved caspase-3, bcl-2, bcl-xl, PECAM-1, and SMA, as well as in the SOD and MDA production in the corpus cavernosum. Histological analysis of specimens stained for NADPH showed a significant change in the staining quality of the neurons in the dorsal nerves; TUNEL showed a greater apoptotic index in corpus cavernosum cells. With daily oral gavage with 100 mg/kg Rg3, the ICP/mean arterial pressure value was significantly higher than in the controls. The level of cleaved caspase-3, bcl-2, bcl-xl, PECAM-1, and SMA and the number of positively stained nerve fibers tended to revert to normal after Rg3 treatment. The apoptotic index in corpus cavernosum cells was lowered.",Oral gavage with Rg3 appears to both prevent degeneration of neurons in the dorsal nerves and exert an antioxidant effect in the corpus cavernosum of rats.,closed_qa
Is the performance of spinal anesthesia marginally more difficult in the elderly?,"We sought to determine if spinal anesthesia is more difficult to perform in the elderly. All spinal anesthetics administered over 18 months by 18 anesthesiologists were eligible. We excluded anesthetics for hip fractures and cesarean deliveries. We recorded time to completion, number of spinal needles used, and number of approaches. The patients were prospectively divided into three age categories: patients <50 years of age (group 1); 50-70 years of age (group 2); and >70 years of age (group 3). Descriptive statistics and chi-square test were performed. Nine hundred and ninety-nine anesthetics were analyzed. There were 368, 336, and 295 entries in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Although the mean +/- SD (in min) times to accomplish the spinal technique were not significantly different (4.3 +/- 4.1, 4.4 +/- 3.2, and 4.6 +/- 3.4 for groups 1, 2, and 3), there was a statistically greater frequency of more than one spinal needle used and more than one approach needed in the elderly.",We conclude that patient age is a minor independent predictor of increased technical difficulty with spinal anesthesia.,closed_qa
Does [ Organic gallium improve tretinoin-induced osteoporosis in rats ]?,"To investigate the effect of organic gallium and gallium chloride on bone metabolism and their therapeutic effect against tretinoin-induced osteoporosis in rats. Rat models of osteoporosis was established with intragastric administration of tretinoin at the daily dose of 85 mg/kg for 15 days and randomized into control, organic gallium and gallium chloride groups. After administration of the corresponding treatments (none for the control group) for 4 weeks, the changes of the indices for osteoporosis were evaluated through biochemical and pathological approaches. Tretinoin induced obvious changes in bone structure and contents of bone calcium and other elements, causing also significantly increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP), which suggested the development of osteoporosis. Administration of organic gallium and gallium chloride treatments increased the bone density, bone cortex thickness and the percentage of bone trabecula, and Ga, Ca, P contents in the femur and teeth, but lowered the activity of TRAP and AKP, suggesting decreased bone conversion rate. Compared with gallium chloride, organic gallium required smaller dose with better safety to produce better therapeutic effect.",Organic gallium can be safe and effective for treatment of tretinoin-induced osteoporosis in rats.,closed_qa
Are nail-fold capillary abnormalities associated with anti-centromere antibody and severity of digital ischaemia?,"Advances in nail-fold capillaroscopy allow capillary abnormalities to be quantified. Our aim was to investigate, in patients with SSc, the relationships between the degree of nail-fold capillary abnormality and disease subtypes (lcSSc and dcSSc), duration of RP and the presence of (i) severe digital ischaemia (as defined by previous i.v. vasodilators, debridements or amputations), (ii) a positive ACA, (iii) clinically evident calcinosis, (iv) pulmonary arterial hypertension and (v) telangiectases. This was a retrospective study of 176 patients. Six capillary measurements (four semi-automated and two manual) were calculated (automated width, distance between capillaries, tortuosity and derangement, and manual distance and density). Relationships between these measurements and the different clinical features of SSc were examined using multiple linear regressions (adjusted for age, sex and smoking status). One hundred and forty-two patients had lcSSc and 34 had dcSSc. Sixty-eight (39%) had a history of severe digital ischaemia, 66 (38%) were anti-centromere positive, 53 (30%) had clinically evident calcinosis and 26 (15%) had an estimated pulmonary artery pressure of >30 mmHg. Positive associations were found between both automated and manually measured distance between capillaries and (i) presence of severe digital ischaemia and (ii) positive ACA, and reduced density was also associated with positive anti-centromere. Patients with moderate/severe telangiectases had wider capillaries compared with those with 'mild' lesions.","Both severe digital ischaemia and positive ACA are associated with measurable nail-fold capillaroscopic change, which has the potential of being an outcome measure for the structural microvascular disease associated with SSc-spectrum disorders.",closed_qa
Does a review of inpatient ward location and the relationship to Medical Emergency Team call?,"To identify the relationship between in-hospital location and patient outcomes as measured by Medical Emergency Team calls. A narrative systematic review of the literature. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in October 2014 using the electronic databases: Embase, Cochrane, Medline, CINAHL, Science Direct and Google Scholar for the most recent literature from 1997 to 2014. Non-randomised study designs such as case control or cohort studies were eligible. Articles were selected independently by two researchers using a predetermined selection criterion. The screening process removed manuscripts that did not meet the inclusion criteria resulting in an empty review with one manuscript meeting most of the criteria for inclusion. The protocol was revised to a narrative synthesis including a broader scope of studies. The search strategy was expanded and modified to include manuscripts of any study design that comprise both inlier and outlier patients. Two manuscripts were selected for the narrative synthesis.","Two recently published studies investigated the incidence of MET calls for outlier patients, and whilst MET calls were increased in outlier hospital patients, definitive conclusions associated with patient outcomes cannot be made at this time due to paucity of studies.",closed_qa
Is type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with brain atrophy and hypometabolism in the ADNI cohort?,"We investigated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor for brain atrophy and glucose hypometabolism in older adults with or at risk of cognitive impairment. Participants with the T2DM were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1/GO/2 cohorts). Analysis of covariance models were used to compare participants with and without T2DM, controlling for potential confounding factors. Whole brain volume and whole brain [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake were significantly different as a function of T2DM status, independent of baseline clinical diagnosis. On post hoc analysis, a lower whole brain volume was seen in participants with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and T2DM (n = 76) compared with participants who had MCI but not T2DM (n = 747; p = 0.009). Similarly, mean FDG uptake in gray matter and white matter was lower in participants with both MCI and T2DM (n = 72) than in participants with MCI without T2DM (n = 719; p = 0.04). Subsequent regional analysis revealed that the decreased FDG uptake in participants with both MCI and T2DM was mainly manifested in 3 brain regions: frontal lobe, sensory motor cortex, and striatum.",T2DM may accelerate cognition deterioration in patients with MCI by affecting glucose metabolism and brain volume.,closed_qa
Are amino acid substitutions in the hepatitis C virus core region the important predictor of hepatocarcinogenesis?,"We showed previously that amino acid (aa) substitutions in hepatitis C virus core region (HCV-CR) are negative predictors of virologic response to pegylated interferon (IFN) plus ribavirin therapy. HCV-CR induces hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mice, but the clinical impact is still unclear. To evaluate the impact of aa substitutions in HCV-CR on hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed a follow-up study on 313 noncirrhotic consecutive naïve patients infected with HCV genotype 1b who received IFN monotherapy. The median follow-up was 14.7 years. A sustained virologic response (SVR) after the first IFN was achieved by 65 patients (20.8%) (group A). Of 248 patients (79.2%) of non-SVR after first IFN, 112 (35.8%) did not receive additional IFN (group B), and the remaining 136 (43.5%) received multicourse IFN monotherapy (group C). As a whole, cumulative hepatocarcinogenesis rates in double wild-type (arginine at aa 70/leucine at aa 91) of HCV-CR were significantly lower than those in nondouble wild-type. Multivariate analyses identified 3 parameters (fibrosis stage 3, nondouble wild-type of HCV-CR, and group B) that tended to or significantly influenced hepatocarcinogenesis independently. With regard to hepatocarcinogenesis rates in group C according to HCV-CR and the mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during IFN-free period, significantly higher rates were noted in patients of nondouble wild-type with ALT levels of more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (25.7%) compared with the others (2.4%).","Amino acid substitutions in the HCV-CR are the important predictor of hepatocarcinogenesis. In multicourse IFN therapy to nondouble wild-type, we emphasize the importance of reducing the risk of hepatocarcinogenesis by mean ALT during an IFN-free period below 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.",closed_qa
Is tracheomalacia associated with lower FEV1 and Pseudomonas acquisition in children with CF?,"Tracheomalacia (TM) occurs in approximately 1 in 2,100 children. Because the trachea develops abnormally in animal models of cystic fibrosis (CF), we hypothesized this may also occur in children with CF, increasing their risk of TM. To examine the prevalence and clinical consequences of TM in children with CF. We studied children with CF born between 1995 and 2012. TM was defined as dynamic collapse of the trachea, and the severity was recorded as described in the chart. The effect of TM on patient outcomes, including FEV1 , CT changes, and acquisition of CF pathogens, was assessed using a longitudinal patient dataset. Eighty-nine percent of children with CF had at least one bronchoscopy (n = 97/109). Fifteen percent of these children had TM described in any bronchoscopy report (n = 15/97). Of the patients with TM, eight had meconium ileus (P = 0.003) and all were pancreatic insufficient. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection occurred 1.3 years earlier among children with TM (P = 0.01). Starting FEV1 values by age 8 were diminished by over 18% of predicted for patients with TM. Life-threatening episodes of airway obstruction occurred in 3 of 15 patients with CF and TM, including one leading to death. Gender, prematurity, and hepatic disease were not associated with TM. No difference was observed in the frequency of bronchiectasis.",TM is significantly more common in infants and children with CF than in the general population and is associated with airway obstruction and earlier Pseudomonas acquisition.,closed_qa
Is there a connection between paediatric acute idiopathic scrotal oedema and intestinal worm infestation?,A retrospective questionnaire-based study was conducted comparing the frequency of IWI between children who had AISO and a matched control group who had inguinal hernia surgery in our Pediatric Surgery Department during 2003-2009. This second group was chosen to represent the incidence of IWI in the paediatric community in our region. Records of all patients admitted to the Department of Pediatric Surgery for AISO during 2003-2009 were reviewed. Seventeen out of thirty-eight (44.7%) AISO patients had a history of IWI compared with 5/38 (13.1%) in the control group (P= 0.0047).,"Our data clearly show that AISO in children is frequently associated with a history of IWI. Although well-documented, prospective studies are needed to establish these findings, we feel that this report provides a reasonable clue to a possible aetiology of AISO.",closed_qa
Is hysteroscopic sterilization success in outpatient vs office setting affected by patient or procedural characteristics?,"To determine factors associated with hysteroscopic sterilization success and whether it differs between the operating room and office settings. Retrospective cohort analysis (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Major university medical center. Six hundred thirty-eight women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2011. Data collected included age, body mass index, previous office procedures, previous cesarean section, and presence of myomas or retroverted uterus. Place of surgery, experience of surgeon, insurance type, bilateral device placement, compliance with hysterosalpingography, and confirmation of occlusion were also recorded. Bivariate analysis of patient characteristics between groups was performed using χ(2) and independent t tests, and identified confounders and associated variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to assess for association and to adjust for confounders. Procedures were performed in the operating room (57%) or in the office (43%). There was no association between success in bilateral device placement or occlusion and any patient characteristic, regardless of surgery setting. Private insurance, patient age, and performance of procedures in the office setting were positively associated with likelihood of compliance with hysterosalpingography.","Successful device placement and tubal occlusion are independent of patient age, body mass index, or setting of the procedure. Association between insurance type and completing hysterosalpingography illustrates an important public health problem. Patients who fail to undergo hysterosalpingography to confirm tubal occlusion may unknowingly be at risk of pregnancy and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.",closed_qa
Is posterior tympanotomy a riskier procedure in chronic otitis media than in a normal mastoid : a high-resolution computed tomography study?,"The aim of our study was to compare the difficulty in performing a posterior tympanotomy in chronic otitis media (COM) versus the same procedure in a normal mastoid. The study included 122 patients who underwent tympanomastoidectomy for unilateral chronic otitis media with contralateral normal mastoid pneumatization. We evaluated the anatomical relationships between the mastoid segment and neighboring structures by analyzing axial temporal bone computed tomography scans. A vertical line (line A) was drawn tangential to the most lateral end of the posterior semicircular canal (point A). Three distances were measured: the distance (D1) between the point A and the most lateral end of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve (point B), the distance (D2) between the line A and the point B, and the distance (D3) between the point B and the posterior end of the bony annulus of the external auditory canal. The average measurements of D1 and D3 were 3.79 ± 0.55 and 2.63 ± 0.51 mm, respectively, in the normal mastoid ears and 3.47 ± 0.59 and 2.35 ± 0.44 mm, respectively, in the COM ears. The measurements of D1 and D3 were statistically shorter in the COM ears than in the normal ears.",These findings suggest that the facial recess in COM may be narrower than in a normal mastoid and that performing a posterior tympanotomy may be riskier in COM than in a normal mastoid due to the potential for injury to the neighboring structures and the facial nerve.,closed_qa
Does adequately washed bronchoscope induce false-positive amplification tests on bronchial aspirates in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis?,"To investigate the clinical usefulness of amplification (COBAS AMPLICOR; Roche Diagnostics Systems; Branchburg, NJ) on bronchoscopic aspirate specimens in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, with particular regard to the possibility of false-positive results in subsequent specimens due to residual Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA. A prospective clinical study at a tertiary referral medical center. Four hundred fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedures were performed, using seven bronchoscopes on 335 consecutive patients, for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. Serial bronchial aspirates were collected and tested for M tuberculosis, using COBAS AMPLICOR (CA). Bronchoscopes were cleaned and disinfected automatically, between patient use, by the same endoscope washer. The name of each bronchoscope and the sequence of its use were recorded, together with the sequence of washing. The CA results were compared with the bacteriologic and histologic results for M tuberculosis infection. When there was a suspicion of contamination, outward polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed. Of 392 specimens (332 subjects), excluding the 8 specimens (4 subjects) in which bacteriologic and histologic analyses were omitted, a smear-positive result for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), culture-positive or biopsy-positive results, and CA-positive results were obtained in 16, 49, and 32 specimens, respectively. In AFB smear-positive subjects, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 92%, 67%, 92%, and 67%, respectively. In AFB smear-negative subjects, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV values were 38%, 99%, 74%, and 94%, respectively. The CA test was more sensitive than the AFB smears for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (53% vs 27%, respectively; p < 0.05). False-positive CA results were seen in only six specimens. Three of these six subjects received a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis on clinical and radiologic grounds, and none of the six results seemed to be associated with bronchoscopic cross-contamination.","Adequately cleaned and disinfected bronchoscopes did not cause false-positive amplification test results for M tuberculosis on bronchial aspirates by cross-contamination. Furthermore, sensitivity was greater with the CA tests. Therefore, CA tests on bronchial aspirates seem to be useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.",closed_qa
Does transcriptomic analysis reveal specific osmoregulatory adaptive responses in gill mitochondria-rich cells and pavement cells of the Japanese eel?,"Homeostasis of ions and water is important for the maintenance of cellular functions. The regulation of the homeostasis is particularly important in euryhaline fish that migrate between freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) environments. The fish gill, the major tissue that forms an interface separating the extracellular fluids and external water environment, has an effective transport system to maintain and regulate a constant body osmolality. In fish gills, the two major epithelial cells, pavement cells (PVCs) and mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs), are known to play key and complementary roles in ion transport at the interface. Discovering the robust mechanisms underlying the two cell types' response to osmotic stress would benefit our understanding of the fundamental mechanism allowing PVCs and MRCs to handle osmotic stress. Owing to the limited genomic data available on estuarine species, existing knowledge in this area is slim. In this study, transcriptome analyses were conducted using PVCs and MRCs isolated from Japanese eels adapted to FW or SW environments to provide a genome-wide molecular study to unravel the fundamental processes at work. The study identified more than 12,000 transcripts in the gill cells. Interestingly, remarkable differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in PVCs (970 transcripts) instead of MRCs (400 transcripts) in gills of fish adapted to FW or SW. Since PVCs cover more than 90 % of the gill epithelial surface, the greater change in gene expression patterns in PVCs in response to external osmolality is anticipated. In the integrity pathway analysis, 19 common biological functions were identified in PVCs and MRCs. In the enriched signaling pathways analysis, most pathways differed between PVCs and MRCs; 14 enriched pathways were identified in PVCs and 12 in MRCs. The results suggest that the osmoregulatory responses in PVCs and MRCs are cell-type specific, which supports the complementary functions of the cells in osmoregulation.",This is the first study to provide transcriptomic analysis of PVCs and MRCs in gills of eels adapted to FW or SW environments. It describes the cell-type specific transcriptomic network in different tonicity. The findings consolidate the known osmoregulatory pathways and provide molecular insight in osmoregulation. The presented data will be useful for researchers to select their targets for further studies.,closed_qa
Does relative value unit-based compensation shortchange the acute care surgeon?,"Studies have demonstrated that relative value units (RVUs) do not appropriately reflect cognitive effort or time spent in patient care, but RVU continues to be used as a standardized system to track productivity. It is unknown how well RVU reflects the effort of acute care surgeons. Our objective was to determine if RVUs adequately reflect increased surgeon effort required to treat emergent versus elective patients receiving similar procedures. A retrospective analysis using The American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2011 data set was conducted. The control group consisted of patients undergoing elective colectomy, hernia repair, or biliary procedures as identified by Current Procedural Terminology. Comparison was made to emergent cases after being stratified to laparoscopic or open technique. Generalized linear models and logistic regression were used to assess specific outcomes, controlling for demographics and comorbidities of interest. The RVUs, operative time, and length of stay (LOS) were primary variables, with major/minor complications, mortality, and readmissions being evaluated as the relevant outcomes. A total of 442,149 patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program underwent one of the operative procedures of interest; 27,636 biliary (91% laparoscopic; 8.5% open), 28,722 colorectal (40.3% laparoscopic, 59.7% open), and 31,090 hernia (26.6% laparoscopic, 73.4% open) operations. Emergent procedures were found to have average RVU values that were identical to their elective case counterparts. Complication rates were higher and LOS were increased in emergent cases. Odds ratios for complications and readmissions in emergent cases were twice those of elective procedures. Mortality was skewed toward emergent cases.","Our data indicate that the emergent operative management for various procedures is similarly valued despite increased LOS, more complications, higher mortality risk, and subsequently increased physician attention. Our findings suggest that the RVU system for acute care surgeons may need to be reevaluated to better capture the additional work involved in emergent patient care.",closed_qa
Does [ Survival and death cause in 251 systemic sclerosis patients from a single Italian center ]?,"To investigate survival in Italian systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients from a tertiary center, reporting death causes. We analyzed the charts of 251 SSc patients prospectively enrolled in our Rheumatology Unit from 2000 to 2008. Baseline characteristics were recorded. In 2008 the vital status and the causes of death were assessed. Overall and subgroup survival were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. In 2008, 82% of patients were alive, 8% were known to have died and 10% were lost to follow-up. Overall 5- and 8-year survival were 94.8% and 77.1%, respectively. Patients with an age greater than the median value of the cohort (χ²=4.4; p=0.036), diffuse cutaneous SSc (χ²=3.9; p=0.048), digital ulcers (χ²=6; p=0.015), articular (χ²=5.3; p=0.021), lung (χ²=5.6; p=0.018) and heart involvement (χ²=9.3; p=0.002) had a poorer survival than patients without these features. The majority of SSc-related deaths (60%) were secondary to interstitial lung disease and heart involvement (both 33.3%); 50% of non-SSc-related deaths were due to cancer.","Our study reports an improvement in survival of Italian SSc patients during the last decade with respect to the previous ones. Moreover, a reduction in deaths from renal involvement and an increase in deaths from interstitial lung disease were recorded in Italian SSc patients.

Does cAMP inhibit transepithelial chloride secretion across bovine ciliary body/epithelium?,"To investigate the potential significance of cAMP in the regulation of Cl(-) transport across the bovine ciliary body/epithelium (CBE). Fresh native bovine CBE preparation was mounted in a modified Ussing chamber. The effects of cAMP-stimulating agents on short-circuit current (I(sc)) and net (36)Cl(-) secretion were determined. Addition of cAMP-stimulating agents inhibited net Cl(-) secretion. Forskolin, when added bilaterally, reduced Cl(-) secretion by 60%. Similarly, bilateral isoproterenol or vasoactive intestinal peptide inhibited Cl(-) transport by 15% and 37%, respectively, suggesting a cAMP-sensitive Cl(-) transport across the ciliary epithelium. This notion was supported by the exogenous application of 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), which reduced the net Cl(-) secretion by 49% and 85%, respectively. In unstimulated preparations, addition of 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) to the blood side had no effects on I(sc) and net Cl(-) transport, indicating that Cl(-) reabsorption was negligible under baseline conditions. Also, pretreatment with NPPB from the blood side did not prevent forskolin-induced I(sc) inhibition, suggesting that the inhibition of Cl(-) transport did not result from the facilitation of Cl(-) reabsorption. However, pretreatment with heptanol from both sides completely blocked the forskolin-induced I(sc) inhibition, suggesting that cAMP may reduce Cl(-) transport by uncoupling the intercellular gap junctions.","The results suggest that cAMP plays a crucial role in modulating Cl(-) secretion across the ciliary epithelium. The effect is possibly mediated, at least in part, by the regulation of the permeability of gap junctions between pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells.",closed_qa
Does niemann-Pick C1 modulate hepatic triglyceride metabolism and its genetic variation contributes to serum triglyceride levels?,"To study how Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) influences hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism and to determine whether this is reflected in circulating lipid levels. In Npc1(-/-) mice, the hepatic cholesterol content is increased but the TG content is decreased. We investigated lipid metabolism in Npc1(-/-) mouse hepatocytes and the association of NPC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with circulating TGs in humans. TGs were reduced in Npc1(-/-) mouse serum and hepatocytes. In Npc1(-/-) hepatocytes, the incorporation of [3H]oleic acid and [3H]acetate into TG was decreased, but shunting of oleic acid- or acetate-derived [3H]carbons into cholesterol was increased. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis normalized TG synthesis, content, and secretion in Npc1(-/-) hepatocytes, suggesting increased hepatic cholesterol neogenesis as a cause for the reduced TG content and secretion. We found a significant association between serum TG levels and 5 common NPC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a cohort of 1053 men, with the lowest P=8.7 x 10(-4) for the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1429934. The association between the rs1429934 A allele and higher TG levels was replicated in 2 additional cohorts, which included 8041 individuals.","This study provides evidence of the following: (1) in mice, loss of NPC1 function reduces hepatocyte TG content and secretion by increasing the metabolic flux of carbons into cholesterol synthesis; and (2) common variation in NPC1 contributes to serum TG levels in humans.",closed_qa
Do meta-regression analysis of high-frequency ventilation vs conventional ventilation in infant respiratory distress syndrome?,"There is considerable heterogeneity among randomized trials comparing high-frequency ventilation (HFV) with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. We investigated what factors explained differences in outcome among these trials. Meta-regression analysis of 15 randomized trials. Variables were extracted to explain heterogeneity: year of publication; use of Sensormedics 3100A ventilator for HFV; time on CMV prior to start of study; gestational age; use of surfactant; high lung volume strategy in HFV; and lung protective ventilation strategy in CMV and baseline risk. Chronic lung disease (CLD) and death or CLD were outcome measures. Relative risk ratios were calculated to estimate effect sizes of explanatory variables on reported relative risks. Adjusted estimates of relative risk ratios of high lung volume strategy and lung protective ventilation strategy were 0.42 (95% CI 0.06-2.48) and 2.02 (95% CI 0.18-23.12) for CLD, respectively. The effect of gestational age was less pronounced (RRR=1.17 (95% CI 0.16-8.32) for CLD, respectively). Use of Sensormedics and prior time on CMV had the smallest effects [RRR=0.96 (95% CI 0.47-1.94) and RRR=0.85 (95% CI 0.58-1.24) for CLD, respectively)]. The same results applied to CLD or death as outcome.",Variation in ventilation strategies that were used in trials comparing HFV with CMV in premature neonates offered the most likely explanation for the observed differences in the outcome of these trials compared with other explanatory factors.,closed_qa
Is the dyslexia candidate gene DYX1C1 a potential marker of poor survival in breast cancer?,"The dyslexia candidate gene, DYX1C1, shown to regulate and interact with estrogen receptors and involved in the regulation of neuronal migration, has recently been proposed as a putative cancer biomarker. This study was undertaken to assess the prognostic value and therapy-predictive potential of DYX1C1 mRNA and protein expression in breast cancer. DYX1C1 mRNA expression was assessed at the mRNA level in three independent population-derived patient cohorts. An association to estrogen/progesterone receptor status, Elston grade, gene expression subtype and lymph node status was analyzed within these cohorts. DYX1C1 protein expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in cancer and normal breast tissue. The statistical analyses were performed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, ANOVA, Fisher's exact test and a multivariate proportional hazard (Cox) model. DYX1C1 mRNA is significantly more highly expressed in tumors that have been classified as estrogen receptor α and progesterone receptor-positive. The expression of DYX1C1 among the molecular subtypes shows the lowest median expression within the basal type tumors, which are considered to have the worst prognosis. The expression of DYX1C1 is significantly lower in tumors graded as Elston grade 3 compared with grades 1 and 2. DYX1C1 protein is expressed in 88% of tumors and in all 10 normal breast tissues examined. Positive protein expression was significantly correlated to overall survival (Hazard ratio 3.44 [CI 1.84-6.42]) of the patients but not to any of the variables linked with mRNA expression.","We show that the expression of DYX1C1 in breast cancer is associated with several clinicopathological parameters and that loss of DYX1C1 correlates with a more aggressive disease, in turn indicating that DYX1C1 is a potential prognostic biomarker in breast cancer.",closed_qa
Does granisetron show no pro-arrhythmic effect in normal subjects during or after exercise in a hot environment?,"5-HT3 receptor antagonists are being evaluated as possible agents to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with radiation exposure in a non-clinical military setting. Because of concern about potential cardiovascular toxicity and the observation that certain developmental 5-HT3 antagonists produced undesirable effects, all drugs in this class are being carefully scrutinized for possible adverse cardiac effects. In this study, nine subjects underwent ambulatory ECG monitoring for an average of 21.6 h after a 2-mg oral dose of granisetron or placebo in a double-blind crossover protocol. Monitoring included a 3-h period of submaximal exercise in a 40 degrees C environment. Although isolated ventricular and supraventricular ectopic activity, sinus bradycardia, and pauses were found, there were no sustained arrhythmias observed in either the placebo or granisetron conditions.","Although the generalizability of this study is limited by the small number of subjects, these observations add to the body of evidence confirming the lack of cardiovascular toxicity of granisetron.",closed_qa
Does h3N2 influenza infection elicit more cross-reactive and less clonally expanded anti-hemagglutinin antibodies than influenza vaccination?,"During the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, excess morbidity and mortality was seen in young but not older adults suggesting that prior infection with influenza strains may have protected older subjects. In contrast, a history of recent seasonal trivalent vaccine in younger adults was not associated with protection. To study hemagglutinin (HA) antibody responses in influenza immunization and infection, we have studied the day 7 plasma cell repertoires of subjects immunized with seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and compared them to the plasma cell repertoires of subjects experimentally infected (EI) with influenza H3N2 A/Wisconsin/67/2005. The majority of circulating plasma cells after TIV produced influenza-specific antibodies, while most plasma cells after EI produced antibodies that did not react with influenza HA. While anti-HA antibodies from TIV subjects were primarily reactive with single or few HA strains, anti-HA antibodies from EI subjects were isolated that reacted with multiple HA strains. Plasma cell-derived anti-HA antibodies from TIV subjects showed more evidence of clonal expansion compared with antibodies from EI subjects. From an H3N2-infected subject, we isolated a 4-member clonal lineage of broadly cross-reactive antibodies that bound to multiple HA subtypes and neutralized both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. This broad reactivity was not detected in post-infection plasma suggesting this broadly reactive clonal lineage was not immunodominant in this subject.",The presence of broadly reactive subdominant antibody responses in some EI subjects suggests that improved vaccine designs that make broadly reactive antibody responses immunodominant could protect against novel influenza strains.,closed_qa
Do progranulin genetic polymorphisms influence progression of disability and relapse recovery in multiple sclerosis?,"Progranulin (GRN) is a multifunctional protein involved in inflammation and repair, and also a neurotrophic factor critical for neuronal survival. Progranulin is strongly expressed in multiple sclerosis (MS) brains by macrophages and microglia. In this study we evaluated GRN genetic variability in 400 MS patients, in correlation with clinical variables such as disease severity and relapse recovery. We also evaluated serum progranulin levels in the different groups of GRN variants carriers. We found that incomplete recovery after a relapse is correlated with an increased frequency of the rs9897526 A allele (odds ratio (OR) 4.367, p = 0.005). A more severe disease course (Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score > 5) is correlated with an increased frequency of the rs9897526 A allele (OR 1.886, p = 0.002) and of the rs5848 T allele (OR 1.580, p = 0.019). Carriers of the variants associated with a more severe disease course (rs9897526 A, rs5848 T) have significantly lower levels of circulating progranulin (80.5 ± 9.1 ng/mL vs. 165.7 ng/mL, p = 0.01).",GRN genetic polymorphisms likely influence disease course and relapse recovery in MS.,closed_qa

An assessment of patient-based and practice infrastructure-based measures of the patient-centered medical home: do we need to ask the patient?,"To examine the importance of patient-based measures and practice infrastructure measures of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH). A total of 3,671 patient surveys of 202 physicians completing the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) 2006 Comprehensive Care Practice Improvement Module and 14,457 patient chart reviews from 592 physicians completing ABIM's 2007 Diabetes and Hypertension Practice Improvement Module. We estimated the association of patient-centered care and practice infrastructure measures with patient rating of physician quality. We then estimated the association of practice infrastructure and patient rating of care quality with blood pressure (BP) control. Patient-centered care measures dominated practice infrastructure as predictors of patient rating of physician quality. Having all patient-centered care measures in place versus none was associated with an absolute 75.2 percent increase in the likelihood of receiving a top rating. Both patient rating of care quality and practice infrastructure predicted BP control. Receiving a rating of excellent on care quality from all patients was associated with an absolute 4.2 percent improvement in BP control. For reaching the maximum practice-infrastructure score, this figure was 4.5 percent.",Assessment of physician practices for PCMH qualification should consider both patient based patient-centered care measures and practice infrastructure measures.,closed_qa
Does huR mediate the synergistic effects of angiotensin II and IL-1β on vascular COX-2 expression and cell migration?,"Angiotensin II (AngII) and IL-1β are involved in cardiovascular diseases through the induction of inflammatory pathways. HuR is an adenylate- and uridylate-rich element (ARE)-binding protein involved in the mRNA stabilization of many genes. This study investigated the contribution of HuR to the increased expression of COX-2 induced by AngII and IL-1β and its consequences on VSMC migration and remodelling. Rat and human VSMCs were stimulated with AngII (0.1 μM) and/or IL-1β (10 ng · mL(-1)). Mice were infused with AngII or subjected to carotid artery ligation. mRNA and protein levels were assayed by quantitative PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell migration was measured by wound healing and transwell assays. In VSMCs, AngII potentiated COX-2 and tenascin-C expressions and cell migration induced by IL-1β. This effect of AngII on IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression was accompanied by increased COX-2 3' untranslated region reporter activity and mRNA stability, mediated through cytoplasmic HuR translocation and COX-2 mRNA binding. These effects were blocked by ERK1/2 and HuR inhibitors. VSMC migration was reduced by blockade of ERK1/2, HuR, COX-2, TXAS, TP and EP receptors. HuR, COX-2, mPGES-1 and TXAS expressions were increased in AngII-infused mouse aortas and in carotid-ligated arteries. AngII-induced tenascin-C expression and vascular remodelling were abolished by celecoxib and by mPGES-1 deletion.",The synergistic induction of COX-2 by AngII and IL-1β in VSMCs involves HuR through an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism. The HuR/COX-2 axis participates in cell migration and vascular damage. HuR might be a novel target to modulate vascular remodelling.,closed_qa
"Is prostaglandin pathway gene expression in human placenta , amnion and choriodecidua differentially affected by preterm and term labour and by uterine inflammation?","Elucidation of the biochemical pathways involved in activation of preterm and term human labour would facilitate the development of effective management and inform judgements regarding the necessity for preterm tocolysis and post-term induction. Prostaglandins act at all stages of human reproduction, and are potentially activators of labour. Expression of 15 genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis, transport and degradation was measured by qPCR using tissue samples from human placenta, amnion and choriodecidua at preterm and full-term vaginal and caesarean delivery. Cellular localisation of eight prostaglandin pathway proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry. Expression of prostaglandin pathway genes was differentially affected by factors including gestational age at delivery, and the incidence and duration of labour. Chorioamnionitis/deciduitis was associated with upregulation of PTGS2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase and cyclooxygenase)), along with the inflammatory genes IL8 (interleukin 8), S100A8 (S100 calcium binding protein A8) and TLR2 (toll-like receptor 2), in amnion and choriodecidua, and with downregulation of CBR1 (carbonyl reductase 1) and HPGD (hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-(NAD)) in choriodecidua. Protein localisation differed greatly between the various maternal and fetal cell types.","Preterm and term labour are associated with distinct prostaglandin pathway expression profiles; inflammation provokes specific changes, unrelated to the presence of labour; spontaneous and induced term labour are indistinguishable.",closed_qa
Does genomewide association analysis followed by a replication study implicate a novel candidate gene for neuroticism?,"Neuroticism is a trait that reflects a tendency toward negative mood states. It has long been linked to internalizing psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression, and it accounts for much of the substantial comorbidity seen between these disorders. To identify common genetic variants that affect neuroticism to better understand (the comorbidity between) a broad range of psychiatric disorders and to develop effective treatments. More than 420,000 genetic markers were tested for their association with neuroticism in a genomewide association study (GWAS). The GWAS sample consisted of 1227 healthy individuals ascertained from a US national sampling frame and available from the National Institute of Mental Health genetics repository. The most promising markers were subsequently tested in a German replication sample comprising 1880 healthy individuals. A strict definition of replication (same marker, same direction of effects, and same measure) combined with a threshold we proposed previously for declaring significance in genetic studies that ensures a mean probability of producing false-positive findings of less than 10%. The most promising results in the GWAS and replication samples were single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene MAMDC1. These SNPs all tagged the same 2 haplotypes and had P values of 10(-5) to 10(-6) in the GWAS sample and of .006 to .02 in the replication sample. Furthermore, the replication involved the same SNPs and the same direction of effects. In a combined analysis of all data, several SNPs were significant according to the threshold that allows for 10% false-positive findings.","The small effect sizes may limit the prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic use of SNP markers such as those in MAMDC1. However, the present study demonstrates the potential of a GWAS to discover potentially important pathogenic pathways for which clinically more powerful (bio)markers may eventually be developed.",closed_qa
Does alteration in emergency theatre prioritisation alter outcome for acute appendicitis : comparative cohort study?,"Despite dedicated emergency theatre, emergency surgery can be often delayed due to competing urgencies, suggesting a need for innovative theatre time management. To investigate if a change in the emergency theatre prioritisation affects outcomes for a common urgent operation such as appendicectomy. We prospectively recorded data from 67 patients undergoing appendicectomy, for two cohorts of patients: before and after change in theatre prioritisation: Group 1 (Jan-Mar) and 2 (Aug-Oct) respectively. Demographic and peri-operative data, time from admission to surgery, postoperative length of stay and total length of stay and complications were compared. The two groups were comparable with regards to gender, age, time of admission and histological confirmation of appendicitis. No differences between the two groups were found regarding time from admission to surgery (24.4 (95% CI 11.2;27.6) hours versus 16.1 (95% CI 10.4;21.7) hours, Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.35), postoperative length of stay (90.8 (95% CI 61.4;120.1) hours versus 70 (95% CI 48.3;91.6) hours, Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.25) and total length of stay (115.2 (95% CI 84.6;145.7) hours versus 86 (95% CI 61.6;110.4) hours, Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.07) as well as complication or re-admission rates.",A change in the emergency theatre prioritisation does not affect outcome for appendicectomy.

Health effects of ambient air pollution: do different methods for estimating exposure lead to different results?,"Spatially resolved exposure models are increasingly used in epidemiology. We previously reported that, although exhibiting a moderate correlation, pregnancy nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels estimated by the nearest air quality monitoring station (AQMS) model and a geostatistical model, showed similar associations with infant birth weight. We extended this study by comparing a total of four exposure models, including two highly spatially resolved models: a land-use regression (LUR) model and a dispersion model. Comparisons were made in terms of predicted NO2 and particle (aerodynamic diameter<10 μm, PM10) exposure and adjusted association with birth weight. The four exposure models were implemented in two French metropolitan areas where 1026 pregnant women were followed as part of the EDEN mother-child cohort. Correlations between model predictions were high (≥ 0.70), except for NO2 between the AQMS and both the LUR (r = 0.54) and dispersion models (r = 0.63). Spatial variations as estimated by the AQMS model were greater for NO2 (95%) than for PM10 (22%). The direction of effect estimates of NO2 on birth weight varied according to the exposure model, while PM10 effect estimates were more consistent across exposure models.","For PM10, highly spatially resolved exposure model agreed with the poor spatial resolution AQMS model in terms of estimated pollutant levels and health effects. For more spatially heterogeneous pollutants like NO2, although predicted levels from spatially resolved models (all but AQMS) agreed with each other, our results suggest that some may disagree with each other as well as with the AQMS regarding the direction of the estimated health effects.",closed_qa
Is helicobacter pylori a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy?,"Helicobacter pylori infection has been described as a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver disease although the topic remains controversial. To determine whether Helicobacter pylori infection is an independent predictive factor for encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis. Clinical, epidemiological, analytical and nutritional parameters of 205 patients were collected. Helicobacter pylori infection was determined by serology. Encephalopathy (grade II or higher) was clinically assessed during follow-up. The relationship between each parameter and encephalopathy was analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves and the Log rank test. The most significant parameters underwent multivariate analysis by Cox regression. Twenty-five variables were related to encephalopathy in the bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis selected five independent factors: previous bouts of encephalopathy (Odds ratio 3.79; 95% confidence interval 1.94-7.38), albumin (Odds ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.80-0.92), tricipital skin fold (Odds ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.95) chronic pulmonary disease (Odds ratio 2.78, 95% confidence interval; 1.31-5.92), and on-going alcoholism (Odds ratio 2.62; 95% confidence interval 1.16-5.

Is lumbar disc degeneration associated with modic change and high paraspinal fat content - a 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging study?,"Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine is common, with severe disease increasing the risk for chronic low back pain. This cross-sectional study examined whether disc degeneration is representative of a 'whole-organ' pathology, by examining its association with bone (vertebral endplate) and soft tissue (paraspinal muscle fat) abnormalities. Seventy-two community-based individuals unselected for low back pain, had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Lumbosacral disc degeneration was determined via the Pfirrmann grading system, a validated method to assess the intervertebral disc, distinguishing the nucleus and annulus, the signal intensity and the height of the intervertebral disc. Modic change and high paraspinal muscle fat content was also measured from MRI. Severe disc degeneration was associated, or tended to be associated with type 2 Modic change from L2 to L5 (OR range 3.5 to 25.3, p ≤ 0.06). Moreover, severe disc degeneration at all intervertebral levels was associated with or tended to be associated with high fat content of the paraspinal muscles (OR range 3.7 to 14.3, p ≤ 0.09).","These data demonstrate that disc degeneration of the lumbar spine is commonly accompanied by Modic change and high fat content of paraspinal muscles, thus representing a 'whole-organ' pathology. Longitudinal studies are required to determine the temporal relationship between these structural abnormalities.

Does complement inhibition by soluble complement receptor type 1 improve microcirculation after rat liver transplantation?,"Recent observations provide evidence that complement is involved in the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, we assessed the impact of complement inhibition on hepatic microcirculation and graft function using a rat model of liver transplantation. Arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in Lewis rats after cold preservation (University of Wisconsin solution, 4 degrees C, 24 h). Eight animals received the physiological complement regulator soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) intravenously 1 min before reperfusion. Controls received Ringer's solution (n=8). Microvascular perfusion, leukocyte adhesion, and Kupffer cell phagocytic activity were studied 30-100 min after reperfusion by in vivo microscopy. Microvascular perfusion in hepatic sinusoids was improved in the sCR1 group (87+/-0.7% vs. 50+/-1%; P < 0.001). The number of adherent leukocytes was reduced in sinusoids (68.3+/-4.7 vs. 334.1+/-15.8 [adherent leukocytes per mm < or = liver surface]; P < 0.001) and in postsinusoidal venules after sCR1 treatment (306.6+/-21.8 vs. 931.6+/-55.9 [adherent leukocytes per mm < or = endothelial surface]; P < 0.001). Kupffer cell phagocytic activity was decreased in the sCR1 group compared to controls. Postischemic bile production reflecting hepatocellular function was increased by almost 200% (P = 0.004) after complement inhibition. Plasmatic liver enzyme activity was decreased significantly upon sCR1 treatment, indicating reduced parenchymal cell injury.",Our results provide further evidence that the complement system plays a decisive role in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. We conclude that complement inhibition by sCR1 represents an effective treatment to prevent reperfusion injury in liver transplantation.,closed_qa
Can dietary interventions change diet and cardiovascular risk factors?,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of dietary advice in primary prevention of chronic disease. A meta-analysis was conducted of 17 randomized controlled trials of dietary behavior interventions of at least 3 months' duration. Results were analyzed as changes in reported dietary fat intakes and biomedical measures (serum cholesterol, urinary sodium, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in the intervention group minus changes in the control group at 3 to 6 months and 9 to 18 months of follow-up. After 3 to 6 months, mean net changes in each of the five outcomes favored intervention. For dietary fat as a percentage of food energy, the change was -2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -3.9%, -1.1%). Mean net changes over 9 to 18 months were as follows: serum cholesterol, -0.22 (95% CI = -0.39, -0.05) mmol/L; urinary sodium, -45.0 (95% CI = -57.1, -32.8) mmol/24 hours; systolic blood pressure, -1.9 (95% CI = -3.0, 0.8) mm Hg; and diastolic blood pressure, -1.2 (95% CI = -2.6, 0.2) mm Hg.",Individual dietary interventions in primary prevention can achieve modest improvements in diet and cardiovascular disease risk status that are maintained for 9 to 18 months.,closed_qa
Do myeloperoxidase and C-reactive protein augment the specificity of B-type natriuretic peptide in community screening for systolic heart failure?,"N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (N-BNP) is elevated in left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and may be cost-effective for screening in the community but is relatively nonspecific. We sought to improve specificity using inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), which have been implicated in cardiovascular disease. A total of 1360 subjects (45-80 years) were invited in this prospective screening study for undiagnosed LVSD (defined as wall motion score >1.8 [ejection fraction < or = 40%]), and 1331 had analyzable echocardiographic scans and plasma specimens. Peptides were measured using immunoluminometric assays. Twenty-eight patients with LVSD had elevated plasma N-BNP, CRP, and MPO levels compared with healthy subjects (P < .0005). Receiver operating characteristic curve areas for N-BNP, CRP, and MPO were 0.839, 0.824, and 0.909, respectively. All tests had high negative predictive values (>99%). Specificity was maximized to 88.4% in a logistic model with all 3 markers (all independent predictors, accounting for 44.8% of the variance). This reduced the number of cases to scan to detect 1 case of LVSD from 29.7 (using N-BNP alone) to 6.6. Using plasma MPO (at 33.9 ng/mL) or urinary N-BNP (at 10.7 fmol/mL) as initial screening tests, combinations of plasma N-BNP, MPO, and CRP can achieve specificities up to a maximum of 94.3%. Costs were minimized by using urinary N-BNP as the initial screening test, followed by plasma biomarkers.","Plasma CRP and MPO increased the specificity of N-BNP in LVSD screening.

Does combretastatin A-1 phosphate potentiate the antitumour activity of cisplatin in a murine adenocarcinoma model?,"The tubulin depolymerizing drug Combretastatin A-1 phosphate (CA1P), a water-soluble derivative of combretastatin A-1, has been recently shown to have a better efficacy in experimental models than the clinically active, close structural analogue, combretastatin A-4 phosphate (CA4P). Previous studies with CA4P in combination with standard anti-cancer agents have demonstrated improved efficacy relative to the standard agents. In this study the synergistic effects of administering CA1P in combination with cisplatin (CPL) in a well-differentiated transplantable murine colon model (MAC 29) was evaluated. CA1P at 100 mgkg-1 significantly potentiated the anti-tumour effects of CPL.

Is oxidative stress associated with greater mortality in older women living in the community?,"To determine whether oxidative stress, as implied by oxidative damage to proteins, is associated with greater mortality in older women living in the community. Longitudinal. Women's Health and Aging Study I, Baltimore, Maryland. Seven hundred forty-six moderately to severely disabled women, aged 65 and older, with baseline measures of serum protein carbonyls. Serum protein carbonyls, which consist of chemically stable aldehyde and ketone groups produced on protein side chains when they are oxidized, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. During 5 years of follow-up, 202 (27.1%) participants died. Geometric mean serum protein carbonyls were 0.091 nmol/mg in women who died and 0.083 nmol/mg in those who survived (P=.02). Log(e) protein carbonyls (nmol/mg) were associated with greater risk of mortality (hazards ratio=1.34, 95% confidence interval=1.01-1.79, P=.04) in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, current smoking, and body mass index.","Greater oxidative stress, as indicated by elevated serum protein carbonyl concentrations, was associated with greater risk of death in older women living in the community who were moderately to severely disabled.

Do Inflammatory Indices Play a Role in Distinguishing between Uncomplicated and Complicated Diverticulitis?,"The usefulness of inflammatory indices in assessment of the severity of acute diverticulitis remains unestablished. The aim of this study was to determine whether inflammatory indices and hematological ratios could be utilised to differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis. Hematological and inflammatory indices were recorded for each admission with CT confirmed acute diverticulitis (101 complicated, 127 uncomplicated). Cases were divided into training (n = 57) and test sets (n = 171). A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was employed in the training set to identify optimal inflammatory marker cut-off points associated with complicated diverticulitis. Samples (test set) were then categorized as (A) greater than and (B) less than CART identified cut-off points. The predictive properties of inflammatory marker cut-off points in distinguishing severity of diverticulitis were assessed using a univariate logistic regression analysis, summary receiver operating characteristic curves and confusion matrix generation. C-reactive protein>109 mg/ml (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.43-6.61, p = 0.004, area under the curve; AUC = 0.64) and white cell lymphocyte ratio (WLR)>17.72 (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.95-9.17, p<0.001, AUC = 0.64) were the most accurate parameters in distinguishing complicated and uncomplicated disease.

Does heart rate variability predict short-term outcome for successfully resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest?,"To assess the possibility of heart rate variability (HRV) measures as predictors of 24-h mortality in successfully resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This prospective cohort study was conducted at a 40-bed emergency department (ED) of a university-affiliated medical centre. Adult patients with OHCA who were successfully resuscitated were consecutively enrolled over an 18-month period. A 10-min electrocardiogram was recorded for retrospective off-line HRV analysis 30-60 min after the return of spontaneous circulation and further correlated with 24-h mortality of the patients. Sixty-nine patients aged 31-82 years who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. According to the 24-h mortality, the patients were categorised into non-survivors (n=28) and survivors (n=41) groups. The HRV measures were compared between these two groups. The low-frequency power (LFP), normalized LFP (nLFP) and low-/high-frequency power ratio in the non-survivors were significantly lower than those of the survivors, whereas root mean square successive difference, high-frequency power (HFP), HFP/tidal volume, normalized HFP (nHFP), and nHFP/tidal volume in the non-survivors were significantly higher than those of the survivors. Multiple logistic regression model identified nLFP as the independent variable to predict 24-h mortality (odds ratio, 1.354; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.124-1.632; p=0.001). Receiver operating characteristic area for nLFP in the prediction of 24-h mortality was 0.946 (95% CI, 0.897-0.995; p<0.001).","HRV measures, especially the nLFP, may be used as predictors of 24-h mortality for successfully resuscitated patients with OHCA in the ED.",closed_qa
Can we treat select terrible triad injuries nonoperatively?,"While the majority of terrible triad elbow injuries (ulnohumeral dislocation with radial head and coronoid fractures) are managed surgically, nonoperative treatment may be appropriate in selected patients, but results with this approach have been limited by very small studies.QUESTIONS/ We assessed (1) functional outcomes using two validated questionnaires, (2) elbow ROM, strength, and stability, (3) the presence of union and arthritis on radiographs, and (4) complications among a group of patients managed nonoperatively for terrible triad injuries. Between 2006 and 2012, we retrospectively identified 12 patients with terrible triad elbow injuries who were treated nonoperatively and met the following criteria: (1) a concentric joint reduction, (2) a radial head fracture that did not cause a mechanical block to rotation, (3) a smaller coronoid fracture (Regan-Morrey Type 1 or 2), and (4) a stable arc of motion to a minimum of 30° of extension to allow active motion within the first 10 days. Eleven patients were available for followup of at least 12 months after the injury (mean, 36 months; range, 12-90 months). Outcome measures included two patient-reported functional outcome measures (DASH, Mayo Elbow Performance Index [MEPI]), a standardized physical examination to record elbow ROM and stability, isometric strength measurements, and radiographic evidence of bony union and elbow arthrosis. Complications were also recorded. At latest followup, mean ± SD DASH score was 8.0 ± 11.0 and mean MEPI score was 94 ± 9. Mean ROM of the affected elbow was 134° ± 5° flexion, 6° ± 8° extension, 87° ± 4° pronation, and 82° ± 10° supination. No instability was detected. Strength assessments demonstrated the following mean percentages of the contralateral, unaffected elbow: flexion 100%, extension 89%, pronation 79%, and supination 89%. Four patients had arthritic changes on radiographs that did not call for treatment as of latest followup. Complications included one patient who underwent surgical stabilization for early recurrent instability and another who underwent arthroscopic débridement for heterotopic bone.","In selected patients, nonoperative treatment of terrible triad injuries is an option that can provide good function and restore stable elbow ROM.

Parents play an important role in their children's sexual health development. An integral part of this includes effective parent-child sexuality communication. A nationwide cross-sectional community-based household survey was conducted in Singapore between August 2008 and March 2009 to assess parents'/caregivers' attitudes and practices regarding caregiver-child sexuality communication. With an overall response rate of 81.4%, 1169 questionnaires from parents/caregivers of children aged 10 to 17 years were analysed. Almost all (94.2%) the caregivers were parents. A majority (>80%) of caregivers considered talking to their children about sexuality issues such as abstinence, consequences of premarital sex and condom use as important. However, a significantly lower percentage (about 60%) felt comfortable and confident doing so. Only 8.3% among them discussed sexual health issues with their children very often, 37.2% sometimes, 22.0% seldom/hardly ever (once or twice) and 32.5% never, in the past year. In the multivariate analysis, caregiver-child sexuality communication was significantly associated with caregivers' relationship to children, ethnicity, educational level, and their perceived levels of comfort and confidence in sexuality communication.","Caregivers generally felt it was important but were significantly much less comfortable and confident talking about sexuality issues with their children, which leads to a lower frequency of caregiver-child sexuality communication. Educational programmes on adolescent sexual health targeting parents/caregivers are needed. They must be equipped with skills and provided with resources to enable them to talk to their adolescent children about sexuality.",closed_qa
Can we direct organ allocation based on predicted outcome?,"In this study, we ask between patients with graft failure listed for retransplant and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outside of UCSF criteria, who has the greater survival benefit with transplantation? This is a retrospective analysis, of liver transplant (LT) patients, done between February 2002 and December 2009 at our center. Patients were included in the ""extended HCC"" group if their tumor was pathologically beyond UCSF criteria at LT and in the ""redo"" group if they underwent LT for graft failure occurring more than 3 months after the initial LT. Extended criteria donors (ECDs) were defined as donors above 70 years old, DCD, serology positive for HCV, and split grafts. There were 25 redos and 37 extended HCC patients. Use of ECDs or high donor risk index organs was associated with poor outcome in both groups (P = 0.005). Overall, the extended HCC population had a much better survival than redos, both at 1 and 3 years.","These two very different but high risk patient populations have very different survival rates. At a time where regulatory agencies demand more and more with regards to transplant outcomes, we think the transplant community has to reflect on whether allocation justice and fair access to transplant are respected if we start allocating organs based on outcomes.",closed_qa
Does caffeine have no effect on measures of cortical excitability?,"To assess the effect of caffeine on motor thresholds, short interval intra-cortical inhibition (SICI), intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) and cortical silent periods in a placebo controlled double-blinded trial. In eleven healthy non-smoking subjects the following parameters were measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): motor thresholds (rest, RMT and active, AMT), SICI and ICF at different conditioning stimulus intensities (60, 70, 80, 90% AMT), cortical silent periods at 130, 150 and 175% AMT, and size of motor evoked potential at rest at 110, 125 and 150% RMT. Measurements were repeated after one cup of decaffeinated coffee. On another day, measurements were obtained before and after one cup of decaffeinated coffee that contained caffeine (3 mg/kg bodyweight). Caffeine concentrations were measured in serum before and after experiments. Experiments were conducted and data were evaluated blinded to the experimental condition. The results of repeated measurements of all parameters were similar comparing experiments on each day, or when comparing the caffeine arm of the study with the placebo arm.",Caffeine in a concentration similar to that in a strong cup of coffee does not have a major effect on TMS measures of motor cortex excitability.,closed_qa
Do hepatitis B surface antigen serum levels help to distinguish active from inactive hepatitis B virus genotype D carriers?,"The accurate identification of inactive (serum HBV-DNA persistently <or=2000 IU/mL) hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers (IC) is difficult because of wide and frequent HBV-DNA fluctuations. We studied whether hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serum levels (HBsAgsl) quantification may contribute to diagnosis of HBV phases in untreated hepatitis B e antigen-negative genotype D asymptomatic carriers. HBsAgsl were measured at baseline and end of follow-up and correlated with virologic and biochemical profiles of 209 consecutive carriers followed-up prospectively (median, 29; range, 12-110 months). HBV phases were defined after 1-year monthly monitoring of HBV-DNA and transaminases. HBsAgsl were significantly lower in 56 inactive carriers (IC) than 153 active carriers (AC): median, 62.12 (range, 0.1-4068) vs median, 3029 (range, 0.5-82,480) IU/mL; P<.001. Among AC, HBsAgsl were lower in 31 AC whose viremia remained persistently <20,000 IU/mL (AC1) than in 122 AC with fluctuations>or=20,000 IU/mL (AC2): 883 (0.5-7838) vs 4233 (164-82,480) IU/mL, P=.002. HBV infection was less productive in IC and AC1 than AC2 (log10 HBV-DNA/HBsAgsl ratios 0.25 and 0.49 vs 2.06, respectively, P<.001) and in chronic hepatitis than cirrhosis (1.97 vs 2.34, respectively; P=.023). The combined single point quantification of HBsAg (<1000 IU/mL) and HBV-DNA (<or=2000 IU/mL) identified IC with 94.3% diagnostic accuracy, 91.1% sensitivity, 95.4% specificity, 87.9% positive predictive value, 96.7% negative predictive value. During follow-up, HBsAgsl were stable in AC but declined in IC (yearly median decline, -0.0120 vs -0.0768 log10 IU/mL, respectively, P<.001), 10 of whom cleared HBsAg.","HBsAgsl vary during chronic hepatitis B e antigen-negative genotype D infection and are significantly lower in IC. Single-point combined HBsAg and HBV-DNA quantification provides the most accurate identification of IC, comparable with that of long-term tight monitoring.",closed_qa
Does curcumin improve LPS-induced preeclampsia-like phenotype in rat by inhibiting the TLR4 signaling pathway?,"Abnormal inflammation mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway contributes to preeclampsia (PE). Because curcumin can inhibit TLR4 signaling pathway, we investigated its effects on a PE rat model. Twenty-one pregnant rats were randomly divided into three groups: 1) seven rats were injected 0.5 μg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day (GD) 5 to create a PE model (LPS-treated group), 2) seven rats were injected with a similar dosage of LPS and further treated with curcumin (0.36 mg/kg) (LPS-curcumin-treated group), 3) seven rats received saline (control group). Blood pressure and urinary protein level were observed. Immunostaining and periodic acid-Schiff staining of placenta were conducted. TLR4 and downstream Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) expressions of placenta were analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. IL-6 and MCP-1 in rat serum and placenta were determined by ELISA and qRT-PCR. Compared to LPS-treated group, LPS-curcumin-treated group had decreased blood pressure and urinary protein level, similar to control group. Furthermore, deficient trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling induced by LPS were improved by curcumin. Increased TLR4, NF-κB and IL-6, MCP-1 protein expressions in LPS-treated group were significantly decreased after curcumin administration.",Curcumin improves the PE-like phenotype in rat model by reducing abnormal inflammation related to TLR4 signaling pathway.,closed_qa
Does dietary carbohydrate source influence molecular fingerprints of the rat faecal microbiota?,"A study was designed to elucidate effects of selected carbohydrates on composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota. Five groups of eight rats were fed a western type diet containing cornstarch (reference group), sucrose, potato starch, inulin (a long- chained fructan) or oligofructose (a short-chained fructan). Fructans are, opposite sucrose and starches, not digestible by mammalian gut enzymes, but are known to be fermentable by specific bacteria in the large intestine. Animals fed with diets containing potato starch, or either of the fructans had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher caecal weight and lower caecal pH when compared to the reference group, indicating increased fermentation. Selective cultivation from faeces revealed a higher amount of lactic acid bacteria cultivable on Rogosa agar in these animals. Additionally, the fructan groups had a lower amount of coliform bacteria in faeces. In the inulin and oligofructose groups, higher levels of butyrate and propionate, respectively, were measured.Principal Component Analysis of profiles of the faecal microbiota obtained by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes as well as of Reverse Transcriptase-PCR amplified bacterial 16S rRNA resulted in different phylogenetic profiles for each of the five animal groups as revealed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of band patterns.","Even though sucrose and cornstarch are both easily digestible and are not expected to reach the large intestine, the DGGE band patterns obtained indicated that these carbohydrates indeed affected the composition of bacteria in the large gut. Also the two fructans resulted in completely different molecular fingerprints of the faecal microbiota, indicating that even though they are chemically similar, different intestinal bacteria ferment them. Comparison of DNA-based and RNA-based profiles suggested that two species within the phylum Bacteroidetes were not abundant in numbers but had a particularly high ribosome content in the animals fed with inulin.",closed_qa
Does night work and breast cancer estrogen receptor status -- result from the German GENICA study?,"The potential mechanisms that link night-shift work with breast cancer have been extensively discussed. Exposure to light at night (LAN) depletes melatonin that has oncostatic and anti-estrogenic properties and may lead to a modified expression of estrogen receptor (ER) α. Here, we explored the association between shift work and breast cancer in subgroups of patients with ER-positive and -negative tumors. GENICA (Gene-ENvironment Interaction and breast CAncer) is a population-based case-control study on breast cancer with detailed information on shift work from 857 breast cancer cases and 892 controls. ER status was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Associations between night-shift work and ER-positive and -negative breast cancer were analyzed with conditional logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. ER status was assessed for 827 cases and was positive in 653 and negative in 174 breast tumors. Overall, 49 cases and 54 controls were ""ever employed"" in shift work including night shifts for ≥ 1 year. In total, ""ever shift work"" and ""ever night work"" were not associated with an elevated risk of ER-positive or -negative breast tumors. Night work for ≥ 20 years was associated with a significantly elevated risk of ER-negative breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) 4.73, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.22-18.36].",Our case-control study suggests that long-term night-shift work is associated with an increased risk of ER-negative breast cancers. Further studies on histological subtypes and the analysis of other potentially relevant factors are crucial for discovering putative mechanisms.,closed_qa
Does no correlation exist between vitamin B12 and quality of life in healthy young adult population?,"Vitamin B12 (B12) is essential for well-being and healthy life, since it plays a critical role in DNA synthesis, hematopoiesis and neurologic function. B12 deficiency remains one of the most common nutrition deficiencies in the world and is associated with increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental health problem, osteoporosis, and defect-birth outcomes. The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of B12 levels on quality of life (QOL) among healthy university students. This cross-sectional study involved 359 healthy university students (age 18-30 years) of both genders. Their QOL was as vitamin B12 level was measured using the IMx system (Abbott laboratories IMX, USA). No correlation was detected between B12 levels and the two major QOL subscales: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Additionally, none of the other eight subscale of the SF-36 was significantly correlated with b12 levels.",We conclude that no correlation exists between B12 levels and QOL scores among young adult healthy populations. Further investigations are required to confirm the impact of B12 status on QOL among healthy populations.,closed_qa
Is a principal component analysis conducted for a case series quality appraisal checklist?,"Because of a lack of a control group, a case-series study is considered one of the weaker study designs from which to obtain evidence on treatment effectiveness. Under certain circumstances, however, this is the only available evidence to inform health-care decisions. This study's intent was to develop and validate a quality appraisal checklist specifically for case-series studies. A modified Delphi process was used to develop the checklist, which was then used by multiple researchers to appraise a random sample of 105 case-series studies. A principal component analysis of these appraisals was conducted to further refine the checklist. The modified Delphi process resulted in a 20-criterion checklist. The principal component analysis of the appraisals for the 105 case-series studies revealed two components. The first component (10 criteria) indicated the extent to which a case series presented traditional features of a statistical hypothesis-testing paradigm. The second component (seven criteria) indicated whether detailed descriptions of the subjects' characteristics that might feature in the experimental design were present, particularly in judgments about the likelihood of confounding.","This quality appraisal checklist may be useful in assessing case-series studies, but further validation of the checklist is required.",closed_qa
Do severe sepsis and diabetes mellitus have additive effects on red blood cell deformability?,"Diabetes mellitus is accompanied by microvascular complications leading to organ dysfunction, while sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetics. We addressed the hypothesis that red blood cell (RBC) deformability may be additively compromised in septic diabetic patients, leading to a further impairment of microcirculation. Forty patients suffering from severe sepsis, 12 patients suffering from diabetes and 24 diabetic patients with severe sepsis were enrolled. A filtration method and a hemorheometer were used to measure the RBCs' index of rigidity (IR). We observed no differences in severity, organ dysfunction and outcome between diabetic and non-diabetic septic patients. Mean SAPS II score was 23.5% vs 26.8% in non-diabetic and diabetic septic patients, respectively. The mortality in non-diabetic septic patients was 22.5% and in septic diabetics was 34.3%, while septic shock occurred in 15.0% and 20.8%, respectively. We detected higher IR (17.72+/-6.31) in septic diabetics than in patients with diabetes and no sepsis (12.26+/-2.28, p< or =0.001) and in patients with sepsis and no diabetes (13.9+/-2.86, p< or =0.01).","The presence of diabetes mellitus seems to affect the already compromised RBC deformability of septic patients, probably leading to serious microcirculatory functional impairments in septic diabetic patients.",closed_qa
Does deletion of odhA or pyc improve production of γ-aminobutyric acid and its precursor L-glutamate in recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum?,"To enhance γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production in recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum, metabolic engineering strategies were used to improve the supply of the GABA precursor, L-glutamate. C. glutamicum ATCC13032 co-expressing two glutamate decarboxylase genes (gadB1 and gadB2) was constructed in a previous study Shi et al. (J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol 40:1285-1296, 2013) to synthesize GABA from endogenous L-glutamate. To improve its L-glutamate supply, new strains were constructed here. First, the odhA and pyc genes were deleted separately. Then, a gadB1-gadB2 co-expression plasmid was transferred into ΔodhA, Δpyc, and ATCC13032, resulting in recombinant strains SNW201, SNW202, and SNW200, respectively. After fermenting for 72 h, GABA production increased to 29.5 ± 1.1 and 24.9 ± 0.7 g/l in SNW201 and SNW202, respectively, which was significantly higher than that in SNW200 (19.4 ± 2.6 g/l).

Does fiducial registration with spoiled gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging enhance the accuracy of subthalamic nucleus targeting?,"A variety of imaging strategies may be used to derive reliable stereotactic coordinates when performing deep brain stimulation lead implants. No single technique has yet proved optimal. To compare the relative accuracy of stereotactic coordinates for the subthalamic nucleus (STN) derived either from fast spin echo/inversion recovery (FSE/IR) magnetic resonance imaging MRI alone (group 1) or FSE/IR in conjunction with T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo MRI (group 2). A retrospective analysis of 145 consecutive STN deep brain stimulation lead placements (group 1, n = 72; group 2, n = 73) was performed in 81 Parkinson disease patients by 1 surgical team. From the operative reports, we recorded the number of microelectrode recording trajectories required to localize the desired STN target and the span of STN traversed along the implantation trajectory. In addition, we calculated the 3-dimensional vector difference between the initial MRI-derived coordinates and the final physiologically refined coordinates. The proportion of implants completed with just 1 microelectrode recording trajectory was greater (81% vs 58%; P < .001) and the 3-dimensional vector difference between the anatomically selected target and the microelectrode recording-refined target was smaller (0.6 ± 1.2 vs 0.9 ± 1.3; P = .04) in group 2 than in group 1. At the same time, the mean expanse of STN recorded along the implantation trajectory was 8% greater in group 2 (4.8 ± 0.6 vs 5.2 ± 0.6 mm; P < .001).",A combination of stereotactic FSE/IR and spoiled gradient-echo MRI yields more accurate coordinates for the STN than FSE/IR MRI alone.,closed_qa
Does microRNA-585 act as a tumor suppressor in non-small-cell lung cancer by targeting hSMG-1?,"To investigate the role of miR-585 in the development and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression levels of miR-585 in NSCLC cell lines and clinical samples were measured by quantitative PCR. NSCLC cells, A549 and H1299, were stably transfected with lentiviral vectors of miR-585 mimics or negative control. The effects of miR-585 on cell proliferation were detected both in vitro and in vivo. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using wound healing assay and Transwell assay. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the direct regulation of hSMG-1 by miR-585. Our results showed that miR-585 was downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tumor tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-585 inhibited the ability of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In addition, miR-585 also decreased the growth rate of xenografted tumor in nude mice. Mechanically, miR-585 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of hSMG-1 gene, which likely resulted in a dysfunction of mRNA surveillance and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.","Taken together, miR-585 probably has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and is a prognostic biomarker of NSCLC.",closed_qa
Are we doing enough?,"The success of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was remarkable, but four countries - Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nigeria - never interrupted polio transmission. Pakistan reportedly achieved all milestones except interrupting virus transmission. The aim of the study was to establish valid and reliable estimate for: routine oral polio vaccine (OPV) coverage, logistics management and the quality of monitoring systems in health facilities, NIDs OPV coverage, the quality of NIDs service delivery in static centers and mobile teams, and to ultimately provide scientific evidence for tailoring future interventions. A cross-sectional study using lot quality assessment sampling was conducted in the District Nankana Sahib of Pakistan's Punjab province. Twenty primary health centers and their catchment areas were selected randomly as 'lots'. The study involved the evaluation of 1080 children aged 12-23 months for routine OPV coverage, 20 health centers for logistics management and quality of monitoring systems, 420 households for NIDs OPV coverage, 20 static centers and 20 mobile teams for quality of NIDs service delivery. Study instruments were designed according to WHO guidelines. Five out of twenty lots were rejected for unacceptably low routine immunization coverage. The validity of coverage was questionable to extent that all lots were rejected. Among the 54.1% who were able to present immunization cards, only 74.0% had valid immunization. Routine coverage was significantly associated with card availability and socioeconomic factors. The main reasons for routine immunization failure were absence of a vaccinator and unawareness of need for immunization. Health workers (96.9%) were a major source of information. All of the 20 lots were rejected for poor compliance in logistics management and quality of monitoring systems. Mean compliance score and compliance percentage for logistics management were 5.4 +/- 2.0 (scale 0-9) and 59.4% while those for quality of monitoring systems were 3.3 +/- 1.2 (scale 0-6) and 54.2%. The 15 out of 20 lots were rejected for unacceptably low NIDs coverage by finger-mark.

Is fatty liver and fibrosis in glycine N-methyltransferase knockout mice prevented by nicotinamide?,"Deletion of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the main gene involved in liver S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) catabolism, leads to the hepatic accumulation of this molecule and the development of fatty liver and fibrosis in mice. To demonstrate that the excess of hepatic SAM is the main agent contributing to liver disease in GNMT knockout (KO) mice, we treated 1.5-month-old GNMT-KO mice for 6 weeks with nicotinamide (NAM), a substrate of the enzyme NAM N-methyltransferase. NAM administration markedly reduced hepatic SAM content, prevented DNA hypermethylation, and normalized the expression of critical genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. More importantly, NAM treatment prevented the development of fatty liver and fibrosis in GNMT-KO mice. Because GNMT expression is down-regulated in patients with cirrhosis, and because some subjects with GNMT mutations have spontaneous liver disease, the clinical implications of the present findings are obvious, at least with respect to these latter individuals. Because NAM has been used for many years to treat a broad spectrum of diseases (including pellagra and diabetes) without significant side effects, it should be considered in subjects with GNMT mutations.","The findings of this study indicate that the anomalous accumulation of SAM in GNMT-KO mice can be corrected by NAM treatment leading to the normalization of the expression of many genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as reversion of the appearance of the pathologic phenotype.",closed_qa
Does peritoneal instillation of taurolidine or polihexanide modulate intestinal microcirculation in experimental endotoxemia?,"Treatment of peritonitis may include peritoneal lavage/instillation with anti-infective agents like taurolidine or chlorhexidine. We examined the effects of peritoneal instillation (INST, 5-ml solution) with taurolidine (TAURO) or polihexanide (POLI-LS) on intestinal microcirculation using intravital microscopy (IVM) in experimental endotoxemia (15 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide i.v.; LPS) in the rat (n = 8 each group), their direct effects on local small blood vessels, aortal rings, and myocardial strips in vitro, as well as plasma interleukin levels. It was found that LPS produced hypotension (98.8 +/- 9.5 vs 130.4 +/- 10.5 mmHg; mean arterial pressure [MAP], mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), which was further pronounced after INST of TAURO (78.8 +/- 10.8; P < 0.005) or POLI-LS (78.1 +/- 6.0; P < 0.001). IVM revealed a reduction in temporary adhering leucocytes and an increase in firmly adhering leucocytes after INST with TAURO and POLI-LS. Both agents reduced functional capillary density either in the mucosa (POLI-LS vs sham: 259.7 +/- 54 cm/cm(2) vs 337.1 +/- 35.5) or longitudinal muscular layer in LPS rats (TAURO vs sham: 119.8 +/- 14.8 vs 153.7 +/- 11.0).

Does matrix metalloproteinase inhibition modify left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction in pigs?,"Global and regional shape changes that occur within the left ventricular wall after myocardial infarction have been termed infarct expansion. A potential mechanism for this postinfarction remodeling is activation of the matrix metalloproteinases. Accordingly, the present study examined the effects of matrix metalloproteinase inhibition on left ventricular global geometry after myocardial infarction in pigs. Myocardial infarction was created in pigs by means of occlusion of the first and second obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex coronary artery, resulting in a uniform left ventricular free wall infarct size of 21% +/- 2%. At 5 days after infarction, the pigs were randomized to undergo broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibition (n = 9; PD166793, 20 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) by mouth) or myocardial infarction alone (n = 8). Ten pigs served as noninfarction control animals. Left ventricular end-diastolic area, determined by means of echocardiography, was measured 8 weeks after infarction. Left ventricular end-diastolic area increased in both the myocardial infarction plus broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibition and myocardial infarction only groups compared to reference control animals (3.7 +/- 0.2 cm(2)), but was reduced with broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibition compared to myocardial infarction alone (4.5 +/- 0.2 vs 4.9 +/- 0.2 cm(2), respectively; P <.05). Regional radial stress within the infarct region increased in both infarction groups when compared to values obtained from reference control animals (599 +/- 152 g/cm(2)), but was attenuated in the myocardial infarction plus broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibition group compared to the myocardial infarction alone group (663 +/- 108 vs 1242 +/- 251 g/cm(2), respectively; P <.05). Similarly, regional myocardial stiffness increased in both the myocardial infarction plus broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibition and the myocardial infarction only groups compared with that observed in reference control animals (14 +/- 1 rkm, P <.05) but was lower with broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibition than with myocardial infarction alone (42 +/- 6 vs 68 +/- 10 rkm, respectively; P <.05).","Matrix metalloproteinase inhibition reduced postinfarction left ventricular dilation, reduced regional myocardial wall stress, and modified myocardial material properties. These unique findings suggest that increased myocardial matrix metalloproteinase activation after infarction contributes directly to the left ventricular remodeling process.",closed_qa
Does primary prevention of pediatric lead exposure require new approaches to transfusion screening?,"To facilitate further assessment of transfusion-associated lead exposure by designing a procedure to test packed red blood cells (pRBCs) prepared for transfusion. The relationship between pRBCs and whole blood lead concentration was investigated in 27 samples using a modified clinical assay. Lead concentrations were measured in 100 pRBC units. Our sample preparation method demonstrated a correlation between whole blood lead and pRBC lead concentrations (R(2) = 0.82). In addition, all 100 pRBC units tested had detectable lead levels. The median pRBC lead concentration was 0.8 μg/dL, with an SD of 0.8 μg/dL and a range of 0.2-4.1 μg/dL. In addition, after only a few days of storage, approximately 25% of whole blood lead was found in the supernatant plasma.",Transfusion of pRBCs is a source of lead exposure. Here we report the quantification of lead concentration in pRBCs. We found a >20-fold range of lead concentrations in the samples tested. Pretransfusion testing of pRBC units according to our proposed approach or donor screening of whole blood lead and selection of below-average units for transfusion to children would diminish an easily overlooked source of pediatric lead exposure.,closed_qa
Does low-energy laser irradiation accelerate the velocity of tooth movement via stimulation of the alveolar bone remodeling?,"Previously, the authors have reported the acceleration of tooth movement and osteoclastogenesis on the pressure site in an experimental tooth movement model by low-energy laser irradiation (LELI), which stimulated the RANK/RANKL system and c-fms/macrophage colony-stimulating factor system. However, the effect of LELI on osteogenesis on the tension site is not known clearly. Moreover, the temporal changes in alveolar bone during tooth movement have not been investigated as yet. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of LELI on alveolar bone remodeling during experimental tooth movement, and observe the temporal bone mineral density (BMD) using micro-computed tomography (muCT). To induce experimental tooth movement in rats, 10 g force was applied to the upper right first molar with Nickel titanium closed-coil. Next, a gallium-aluminum-arsenide (Ga-Al-As) diode laser was used to irradiate the area around the moved tooth, and BMD and the amount of tooth movement were measured by muCT scanning for 21 days. Histopathological examination was also performed. The amount of tooth movement in the LELI group was significantly greater than in the non-irradiation group by the end of the experimental period. Further, compared with the non-irradiation group, the fall of BMD was less in the LELI group.",These findings suggest that LELI accelerates the velocity of tooth movement via stimulation of the alveolar bone remodeling.,closed_qa
Does mean platelet volume ( MPV ) predict middle distance running performance?,"Running economy and performance in middle distance running depend on several physiological factors, which include anthropometric variables, functional characteristics, training volume and intensity. Since little information is available about hematological predictors of middle distance running time, we investigated whether some hematological parameters may be associated with middle distance running performance in a large sample of recreational runners. The study population consisted in 43 amateur runners (15 females, 28 males; median age 47 years), who successfully concluded a 21.1 km half-marathon at 75-85% of their maximal aerobic power (VO2max). Whole blood was collected 10 min before the run started and immediately thereafter, and hematological testing was completed within 2 hours after sample collection. The values of lymphocytes and eosinophils exhibited a significant decrease compared to pre-run values, whereas those of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, mean platelet volume (MPV), white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils and monocytes were significantly increased after the run. In univariate analysis, significant associations with running time were found for pre-run values of hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), MPV, reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RetCHR), and post-run values of MCH, RDW, MPV, monocytes and RetCHR. In multivariate analysis, in which running time was entered as dependent variable whereas age, sex, blood lactate, body mass index, VO2max, mean training regimen and the hematological parameters significantly associated with running performance in univariate analysis were entered as independent variables, only MPV values before and after the trial remained significantly associated with running time. After adjustment for platelet count, the MPV value before the run (p = 0.042), but not thereafter (p = 0.247), remained significantly associated with running performance.",The significant association between baseline MPV and running time suggest that hyperactive platelets may exert some pleiotropic effects on endurance performance.,closed_qa
Does therapy of psoriasis with narrowband ultraviolet-B light influence plasma concentrations of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in patients?,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which show a significant ability to cleave the components of extracellular matrix, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which slow down the activity of those enzymes, may be implicated in the pathogenesis and spread of psoriatic disease. This study aims to analyze plasma levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in plaque psoriasis patients before and after the course of narrowband ultraviolet-B (NBUVB) therapy with respect to disease advancement. A total of 49 patients suffering from plaque psoriasis and 40 healthy volunteers were enrolled into the study. Plasma levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was used to define the disease advancement. The results showed increased plasma levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2, but this change was significant only in case of MMP-2 in total psoriatic group compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, there was an increase in the concentrations of chosen factors with an increase in the severity of the disease. The NBUVB therapy causes a decline in the concentration of the analyzed enzyme and its inhibitor, although this change was statistically significant in the total psoriatic group only in case of MMP-2. There was also a positive correlation between MMP-2, TIMP-2, and PASI score value.","Our study highlights a possible important role of MMP-2 in the activity of psoriasis and clearance of disease symptoms. Moreover, plasma MMP-2 seems to be a valuable psoriasis biomarker.",closed_qa
Should all endoscopically excised rectal polyps be tattooed?,"More than 5-8 % of endoscopically removed rectal polyps presumed to be benign contain invasive carcinoma. Tattooing has been advocated for follow-up localization of the resection site. Despite proven benefits, the authors propose that tattooing is not routinely performed when benign-appearing rectal polyps are endoscopically excised, thereby confounding management when invasive cancer is found. The secondary goal of the study was to determine the frequency of localization, polyp characteristics, and accuracy of predicting malignant potential at the authors' institution. All patients with rectal neoplasia discovered during endoscopic polypectomy from 1 January 2003 to 1 August 2010 were retrospectively identified from Temple University Hospital's Tumor Registry. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records including polyp size, gross appearance, pathology, resection margins, location based on preoperative colonoscopy, initial removal technique, tattoo performance, and ensuing procedures. During the study period, 49 patients had colonoscopic excision of presumed benign rectal polyps with ensuing diagnosis of neoplasia in the specimen. The malignant histology included adenocarcinoma (n = 5), carcinoma in situ (n = 21), carcinoid (n = 22), and composite carcinoid (n = 1). Only two polyps were tattooed at the initial polypectomy. Three polyps were ""suspicious for malignancy."" None of the suspicious polyps were tattooed. One of the suspicious lesions was an adenocarcinoma, and the remaining two were benign. The distance from the anal verge was noted in only seven patients. The predominant excision technique was hot snare polypectomy (n = 29). None of the incomplete polyp excisions for 15 patients were ""suspicious for malignancy"" or tattooed. Several strategies were used to manage incomplete resections including surveillance (40 %), repeat colonoscopic polypectomy (27 %), and surgery (33 %).","Most malignant rectal polyps are neither diagnosed nor tattooed at initial colonoscopy. Moreover, the distance of the polyp from the anal verge is rarely measured, and gross characteristics are not well described. Tattooing of all endoscopically excised rectal polypectomy sites would avoid confounding of subsequent identification and management.",closed_qa
Is [ Imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells in cord blood influenced by maternal allergic rhinitis and associated with atopic dermatitis during the first two years of life ]?,"To investigate the influence of maternal atopy on cord blood effector T cells and to identify these biologic markers as predictors of atopic dermatitis (AD). Seventy mother-infant pairs were recruited in this prospective birth cohort study. Suspected factors for allergy, including maternal allergic history, total serum IgE, and maternal age at birth, were collected. Mother peripheral blood samples and cord blood were obtained and assayed for the percentage of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) producing T cells(Th1 and Th2 respectively) using flow cytometry. Their offspring at the age of 2 years old were evaluated by their dermatologist whether they had AD. Statistical analysis was performed using multiple logistic regression models and receiver-operating characteristic curve was employed to predict atopic dermatitis. Twenty-one allergic and 49 nonallergic mothers were recruited in this study. During the first two years of life, 15.7% children (n = 11) developed a physician-diagnosed AD (all children were the only child in the family). In group with maternal allergic rhinitis, a significantly increased percentage of Th2 was observed in peripheral blood of mother (7.10[1.18;16.1]% vs. 0.37[0.25;0.72]%, U = 10.0, P < 0.05) and cord blood of newborns (1.02[0.57;1.34]% vs. 0.21[0.15;0.42]%, U = 127.5, P < 0.05), respectively. Maternal atopic history did not affect the percentage of Th1 cells in cord blood (0.69[0.40;1.12]% vs.0.50[0.31;0.66]%, U = 361.0, P > 0.05). Children with reduced Th1/Th2 ratio in cord blood had a higher risk to develop AD (OR = 1.72, P = 0.001) . The model including Th1/Th2, maternal allergy, maternal age at birth and maternal total IgE showed high ability to discriminate children with and without AD. AUC was 0.907 (95% CI: 0.804-1.011, P < 0.001).",Elevated IL-4⁺CD4⁺ T cells in cord blood were of relevance with maternal allergic history. Imbalance between Th1 cell and Th2 cell at birth are associated with maternal allergy and promoted subsequent AD development.,closed_qa
Does expression of recombinant human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein in insect cells confer decreased accumulation of technetium-99m-sestamibi?,"The multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein is a M(r) 170,000 plasma membrane protein encoded by the mammalian multidrug resistance gene (MDR) which appears to function as an efflux transporter of a variety of potent chemotherapeutic agents. To directly demonstrate that 99mTc-sestamibi is recognized by the human P-glycoprotein, we overexpressed recombinant human MDR1 P-glycoprotein in host Sf9 insect cells using a baculoviral vector and correlated expression of the gene product with 99mTc-sestamibi accumulation. In parental Sf9 cells and in wild-type baculoviral infected (control) cells, 99mTc-sestamibi accumulation asymptotically approached a plateau of 650 fmoles (mg protein)-1 (nMo)-1 and 337 fmoles (mg protein)-1 (nMo)-1, respectively. In MDR1 baculoviral infected cells, P-glycoprotein expression was maximal at 72 hr postinfection, while 99mTc-sestamibi accumulation was reduced to 12 fmole (mg protein)-1 (nMo)-1. Verapamil (500 microM), the classical MDR modulator, produced an approximately 300% enhancement of 99mTc-sestamibi accumulation in Sf9 cells expressing MDR1 P-glycoprotein, but only a 50% enhancement in parental Sf9 cells, consistent with verapamil-induced inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated 99mTc-sestamibi efflux.",These data demonstrate that the recombinant protein is transiently expressed in a functional state capable of drug transport in Sf9 cell membranes and that 99mTc-sestamibi is a transport substrate recognized by the human MDR1 P-glycoprotein. Technetium-99m-sestamibi may prove useful for functionally characterizing P-glycoprotein expression in human tumors in vivo.,closed_qa
"Empowerment, engagement and perceived effectiveness in nursing work environments: does experience matter?","We examined the impact of empowering work conditions on nurses' work engagement and effectiveness, and compared differences among these relationships in new graduates and experienced nurses. As many nurses near retirement, every effort is needed to retain nurses and to ensure that work environments are attractive to new nurses. Experience in the profession and generational differences may affect how important work factors interact to affect work behaviours. We conducted a secondary analysis of survey data from two studies and compared the pattern of relationships among study variables in two groups: 185 nurses 2 years post-graduation and 294 nurses with more than 2 years of experience. A multi-group SEM analysis indicated a good fit of the hypothesized model. Work engagement significantly mediated the empowerment/effectiveness relationship in both groups, although the impact of engagement on work effectiveness was significantly stronger for experienced nurses.",Engagement is an important mechanism by which empowerment affects nurses feelings of effectiveness but less important to new graduates' feelings of work effectiveness than empowerment. Implications for nursing management Managers must be aware of the role of empowerment in promoting work engagement and effectiveness and differential effects on new graduates and more seasoned nurses.,closed_qa
Do novel toxin assays implicate Mycoplasma pneumoniae in prolonged ventilator course and hypoxemia?,"Community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin is a unique Mycoplasma pneumoniae virulence factor. Molecular assays targeting this toxin are more sensitive than existing diagnostics, but these assays have not been used to investigate the role of M pneumoniae as a nosocomial infection in critical illness. We sought to determine the incidence of M pneumoniae among mechanically ventilated subjects using these novel assays and to investigate the impact of this pathogen on pulmonary outcomes. We conducted a prospective observational study enrolling subjects with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) undergoing BAL in the surgical trauma ICU at a level I trauma center. Lavage fluid and serum samples were tested for M pneumoniae using assays to detect CARDS toxin gene sequences, protein, or antitoxin antibodies. We collected samples from 37 subjects, with 41% (15 of 37) testing positive using these assays. The positive and negative groups did not differ significantly in baseline demographic characteristics, including age, sex, injury severity, or number of ventilator days before bronchoscopy. The positive group had significantly fewer ventilator-free days (P = .04) and lower average oxygenation (P = .02). These differences were most pronounced among subjects with ARDS.",Evidence is provided that M pneumoniae is present in a substantial number of subjects with suspected VAP. Subjects testing positive experience a significantly longer ventilator course and worse oxygenation compared with subjects testing negative.,closed_qa
Is sentinel lymph node biopsy accurate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer?,"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has proved to be an accurate method for detecting nodal micrometastases in previously untreated patients with early-stage breast cancer. We investigated the accuracy of this technique for patients with more advanced breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with stage II or III breast cancer who had undergone doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy before breast surgery were eligible. Intraoperative lymphatic mapping was performed with peritumoral injections of blue dye alone or in combination with technetium-labeled sulfur colloid. All patients were offered axillary lymph node dissection. Negative sentinel and axillary nodes were subjected to additional processing with serial step sectioning and immunohistochemical staining with an anticytokeratin antibody to detect micrometastases. Fifty-one patients underwent SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 1994 to 1999. The SLN identification rate improved from 64.7% to 94.1%. Twenty-two (51.2%) of the 43 successfully mapped patients had positive SLNs, and in 10 of those 22 patients (45.5%), the SLN was the only positive node. Three patients had false-negative SLN biopsy; that is, the sentinel node was negative, but at least one nonsentinel node contained metastases. Additional processing revealed occult micrometastases in four patients (three in sentinel nodes and one in a nonsentinel node).",SLN biopsy is accurate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The SLN identification improved with experience. False-negative findings occurred at a low rate throughout the series. This technique is a potential way to guide the axillary treatment of patients who are clinically node negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,closed_qa
Does adipose tissue morphology predict improved insulin sensitivity following moderate or pronounced weight loss?,"Cross-sectional studies show that white adipose tissue hypertrophy (few, large adipocytes), in contrast to hyperplasia (many, small adipocytes), associates with insulin resistance and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. We investigated if baseline adipose cellularity could predict improvements in insulin sensitivity following weight loss. Plasma samples and subcutaneous abdominal adipose biopsies were examined in 100 overweight or obese individuals before and 10 weeks after a hypocaloric diet (7±3% weight loss) and in 61 obese subjects before and 2 years after gastric by-pass surgery (33±9% weight loss). The degree of adipose tissue hypertrophy or hyperplasia (termed the morphology value) in each individual was calculated on the basis of the relationship between fat cell volume and total fat mass. Insulin sensitivity was determined by homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMAIR). In both cohorts at baseline, subjects with hypertrophy displayed significantly higher fasting plasma insulin and HOMAIR values than subjects with hyperplasia (P<0.0001), despite similar total fat mass. Plasma insulin and HOMAIR were normalized in both cohorts following weight loss. The improvement (delta insulin or delta HOMAIR) was more pronounced in individuals with hypertrophy, irrespective of whether adipose morphology was used as a continuous (P=0.0002-0.027) or nominal variable (P=0.002-0.047). Absolute adipocyte size associated (although weaker than morphology) with HOMAIR improvement only in the surgery cohort. Anthropometric measures at baseline (fat mass, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio or waist circumference) showed no significant association with delta insulin or delta HOMAIR.","In contrast to anthropometric variables or fat cell size, subcutaneous adipose morphology predicts improvement in insulin sensitivity following both moderate and pronounced weight loss in overweight/obese subjects.",closed_qa
Does tGF-betaRII rescue development of small intestinal epithelial cells in Elf3-deficient mice?,"ELF3, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, has been shown to transactivate the transforming growth factor beta type II receptor (TGF-betaRII) promoter. Previously we showed that Elf3-null mice have a defect in the small intestine caused by a failure of small intestinal epithelial cells to differentiate and that these cells produced significantly lower levels of Tgf-betaRII. To prove that the defect observed in Elf3-null mice resulted from the lack of Elf3-dependent activation of Tgf-betaRII expression, we performed a genetic rescue. We generated transgenic mice that express human TGF-betaRII specifically in the intestinal epithelium under the control of the mouse A33 antigen promoter. Mice expressing the A33-TGF-betaRII transgene were mated with Elf3(+/-) mice, and double heterozygous offspring harboring both the transgene and one mutant Elf3 allele were intercrossed. The resultant A33-TGF-betaRII transgenic Elf3(-/-) pups displayed normal small intestinal morphology, while the characteristic abnormality was retained in all Elf3(-/-) mice that did not express the transgene. This phenotypic rescue shows for the first time in vivo that a single gene, Elf3, is the critical upstream regulator of Tgf-betaRII in mouse small intestinal epithelium.",This has important implications for our understanding of tissue-specific gene regulation and further strengthens the potential clinical connection between ELF3 and colorectal cancer involving transforming growth factor beta insensitivity.,closed_qa
Is increased risk of atherosclerosis confined to CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori strains : prospective results from the Bruneck study?,"Accumulating evidence indicates that a variety of infections contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, but there is controversy concerning the impact of Helicobacter pylori infections in atherosclerosis. We evaluated seropositivity to H pylori and to its cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) product in a large, prospective, population-based study (n=684). Intima-media thickness and atherosclerosis of carotid arteries were thoroughly assessed by high-resolution duplex scanning. In our study population, H pylori infections defined by seropositivity have no relationship with levels of classic cardiovascular risk factors or markers of systemic inflammation, except for elevated levels of immune reactions to mycobacterial heat shock protein 65. The latter showed a trend toward highest levels in those harboring virulent H pylori strains (P=0.08). Common carotid artery intima-media thickness-both absolute values and changes between 1995 and 2000-were significantly enhanced in subjects seropositive to CagA but not in those infected with CagA-negative H pylori strains. There was a clear dose-response relation between anti-CagA antibodies and both intima-media thickness and atherosclerosis risk. Notably, the risk of atherosclerosis associated with CagA seropositivity was amplified by elevated C-reactive protein levels.",Infections with virulent CagA-bearing H pylori strains may contribute to the pathogenesis of early atherosclerosis by aggravating immune-inflammatory reactions.,closed_qa
Does immunoanalysis indicate that the sodium iodide symporter is not overexpressed in intracellular compartments in thyroid and breast cancers?,"The active transport of iodide into thyroid cells is mediated by the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS) located in the basolateral membrane. Strong intracellular staining with anti-NIS antibodies has been reported in thyroid and breast cancers. Our initial objective was to screen tumour samples for intracellular NIS staining and then to study the mechanisms underlying the altered subcellular localization of the transporters. Immunostaining using three different anti-NIS antibodies was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 93 thyroid or breast cancers. Western blot experiments were carried out to determine the amount of NIS protein in 20 samples. Using three different anti-NIS antibodies, we observed intracellular staining in a majority of thyroid tumour samples. Control immunohistochemistry and western blot experiments indicated that this intracellular staining was due to non-specific binding of the antibodies. In breast tumours, very weak intracellular staining was observed in some samples. Western blot experiments suggest that this labelling is also non-specific.","Our results strongly indicate that the NIS protein level is low in thyroid and breast cancers and that the intracellular staining obtained with anti-NIS antibodies corresponds to a non-specific signal. Accordingly, to increase the efficiency of radiotherapy for thyroid cancers and to enable the use of radioiodine in the diagnosis and therapy of breast tumours, improving NIS targeting to the plasma membrane will not be sufficient. Instead, increasing the expression level of NIS should remain the major goal of this field.",closed_qa
Duplex Doppler sonography: is there clinical relevance to elevated renal vein velocity in kidney transplants?,"This study aims to determine a velocity threshold in the main renal vein (MRV) of renal transplants and evaluate the cause and clinical significance of elevated velocity. Maximum MRV velocity from 331 consecutive renal transplant Doppler ultrasounds in 170 patients was recorded. A priori, twice the median MRV velocity was selected as the threshold for elevation. Ultrasounds were divided into ""early"" and ""late"" periods based on time after transplantation. Charts were reviewed for outcomes associated with elevated MRV velocity. Endpoints included graft failure or death. Serum creatinine (Cr) levels among groups were compared, and temporal changes in MRV velocity were plotted. A ≥70 cm/s was chosen as the threshold for elevated MRV velocity. Graft failure and complication/intervention rates were higher only in the ""late"" group with elevated MRV velocity. There was no association between elevated MRV velocity and death, no predilection for a particular biopsy result, and no difference in Cr levels among groups. The majority of elevated velocities occurred during the immediate postoperative period and resolved without intervention.","Elevated MRV velocity in the early postoperative period is a transient phenomenon not correlating with outcome or requiring intervention. In the late period, elevated MRV velocity is associated with entities including hydronephrosis, perinephric collections, and arteriovenous fistulae.",closed_qa
Do measures of reactive balance control predict falls in people with stroke returning to the community?,"To determine if reactive balance control measures predict falls after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. Prospective cohort study. Rehabilitation hospital and community. Independently ambulatory individuals with stroke who were discharged home after inpatient rehabilitation (n=95). Balance and gait measures were obtained from a clinical assessment at discharge from inpatient stroke rehabilitation. Measures of reactive balance control were obtained: (1) during quiet standing; (2) when walking; and (3) in response to large postural perturbations. Participants reported falls and activity levels up to 6 months post-discharge. Logistic and Poisson regressions were used to identify measures of reactive balance control that were related to falls post-discharge. Decreased paretic limb contribution to standing balance control [rate ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 1.0; P=0.011], reduced between-limb synchronisation of quiet standing balance control (rate ratio 0.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 0.9; P<0.0001), increased step length variability (rate ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.7; P=0.0011) and inability to step with the blocked limb (rate ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3; P=0.013) were significantly associated with increased fall rates when controlling for age, stroke severity, functional balance and daily walking activity.","Impaired reactive balance control in standing and walking predicted increased risk of falls post-discharge from stroke rehabilitation. Specifically, measures that revealed the capacity of both limbs to respond to instability were related to increased risk of falls. These results suggest that post-stroke rehabilitation strategies for falls prevention should train responses to instability, and focus on remediating dyscontrol in the more-affected limb.",closed_qa
Are phylogeny and molecular signatures ( conserved proteins and indels ) that specific for the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species?,"The Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species constitute two main groups of the Bacteria that are closely related in phylogenetic trees. The Bacteroidetes species are widely distributed and include many important periodontal pathogens. In contrast, all Chlorobi are anoxygenic obligate photoautotrophs. Very few (or no) biochemical or molecular characteristics are known that are distinctive characteristics of these bacteria, or are commonly shared by them. Systematic blast searches were performed on each open reading frame in the genomes of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83, Bacteroides fragilis YCH46, B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, Gramella forsetii KT0803, Chlorobium luteolum (formerly Pelodictyon luteolum) DSM 273 and Chlorobaculum tepidum (formerly Chlorobium tepidum) TLS to search for proteins that are uniquely present in either all or certain subgroups of Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi. These studies have identified > 600 proteins for which homologues are not found in other organisms. This includes 27 and 51 proteins that are specific for most of the sequenced Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi genomes, respectively; 52 and 38 proteins that are limited to species from the Bacteroidales and Flavobacteriales orders, respectively, and 5 proteins that are common to species from these two orders; 185 proteins that are specific for the Bacteroides genus. Additionally, 6 proteins that are uniquely shared by species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla (one of them also present in the Fibrobacteres) have also been identified. This work also describes two large conserved inserts in DNA polymerase III (DnaE) and alanyl-tRNA synthetase that are distinctive characteristics of the Chlorobi species and a 3 aa deletion in ClpB chaperone that is mainly found in various Bacteroidales, Flavobacteriales and Flexebacteraceae, but generally not found in the homologs from other organisms. Phylogenetic analyses of the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species is also reported based on concatenated sequences for 12 conserved proteins by different methods including the character compatibility (or clique) approach. The placement of Salinibacter ruber with other Bacteroidetes species was not resolved by other phylogenetic methods, but this affiliation was strongly supported by the character compatibility approach.",The molecular signatures described here provide novel tools for identifying and circumscribing species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla as well as some of their main groups in clear terms. These results also provide strong evidence that species from these two phyla (and also possibly Fibrobacteres) are specifically related to each other and they form a single superphylum. Functional studies on these proteins and indels should aid in the discovery of novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are unique to these groups of bacteria.,closed_qa
Do respiratory epithelial cells require Toll-like receptor 4 for induction of human beta-defensin 2 by lipopolysaccharide?,"The respiratory epithelium is a major portal of entry for pathogens and employs innate defense mechanisms to prevent colonization and infection. Induced expression of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD2) represents a direct response by the epithelium to potential infection. Here we provide evidence for the critical role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced HBD2 expression by human A549 epithelial cells. Using RTPCR, fluorescence microscopy, ELISA and luciferase reporter gene assays we quantified interleukin-8, TLR4 and HBD2 expression in unstimulated or agonist-treated A549 and/or HEK293 cells. We also assessed the effect of over expressing wild type and/or mutant TLR4, MyD88 and/or Mal transgenes on LPS-induced HBD2 expression in these cells. We demonstrate that A549 cells express TLR4 on their surface and respond directly to Pseudomonas LPS with increased HBD2 gene and protein expression. These effects are blocked by a TLR4 neutralizing antibody or functionally inactive TLR4, MyD88 and/or Mal transgenes. We further implicate TLR4 in LPS-induced HBD2 production by demonstrating HBD2 expression in LPS non-responsive HEK293 cells transfected with a TLR4 expression plasmid.",This data defines an additional role for TLR4 in the host defense in the lung.,closed_qa
Does redox modification of ryanodine receptors underlie calcium alternans in a canine model of sudden cardiac death?,"Although cardiac alternans is a known predictor of lethal arrhythmias, its underlying causes remain largely undefined in disease settings. The potential role of, and mechanisms responsible for, beat-to-beat alternations in the amplitude of systolic Ca(2+) transients (Ca(2+) alternans) was investigated in a canine post-myocardial infarction (MI) model of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Post-MI dogs had preserved left ventricular (LV) function and susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) during exercise. LV wedge preparations from VF dogs were more susceptible to action potential (AP) alternans and the frequency-dependence of Ca(2+) alternans was shifted towards slower rates in myocytes isolated from VF dogs relative to controls. In both groups of cells, cytosolic Ca(2+) transients ([Ca(2+)](c)) alternated in phase with changes in diastolic Ca(2+) in sarcoplasmic reticulum ([Ca(2+)](SR)), but the dependence of [Ca(2+)](c) amplitude on [Ca(2+)](SR) was steeper in VF cells. Abnormal ryanodine receptor (RyR) function in VF cells was indicated by increased fractional Ca(2+) release for a given amplitude of Ca(2+) current and elevated diastolic RyR-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak. SR Ca(2+) uptake activity did not differ between VF and control cells. VF myocytes had an increased rate of reactive oxygen species production and increased RyR oxidation. Treatment of VF myocytes with reducing agents normalized parameters of Ca(2+) handling and shifted the threshold of Ca(2+) alternans to higher frequencies.",Redox modulation of RyRs promotes generation of Ca(2+) alternans by enhancing the steepness of the Ca(2+) release-load relationship and thereby providing a substrate for post-MI arrhythmias.,closed_qa
Is pelvic organ support different between young nulliparous African and Caucasian women?,"There seems to be substantial variation in the prevalence of pelvic floor disorders between different ethnic groups. This may be due partially to differences in pelvic floor structure and functional anatomy. To date, data on this issue are sparse. The aim of this study was to compare hiatal dimensions, pelvic organ descent and levator biometry in young, healthy nulliparous Caucasian and African women. Healthy nulliparous non-pregnant volunteers attending a local nursing school in Uganda were invited to participate in this study during two fistula camps. All volunteers underwent a simple physician-administered questionnaire and a four-dimensional translabial ultrasound examination. Offline analysis was performed to assess hiatal dimensions, pelvic organ descent, levator muscle thickness and area. To compare findings with those obtained in nulliparous non-pregnant Caucasians, we retrieved the three-dimensional/four-dimensional ultrasound volume datasets of a previously published study. The dataset of 76 Ugandan and 49 Caucasian women was analyzed. The two groups were not matched but they were comparable in age and body mass index. All measurements of hiatal dimensions and pelvic organ descent were significantly higher among the Ugandans (all P ≤ 0.01); however, muscle thickness and area were not significantly different between the two groups.",Substantial differences between Caucasian and Ugandan non-pregnant nulliparae were identified in this study comparing functional pelvic floor anatomy. It appears likely that these differences in functional anatomy are at least partly genetic in nature. Copyright © 2015 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley&Sons Ltd.,closed_qa
Do favourable trends in incidence of AMI in Norway during 2001-2009 include younger adults : a CVDNOR project?,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) incidence reflects levels of risk factors in the general population and influences coronary heart disease mortality rates. We examined trends in AMI incidence in Norway during 2001-2009 and potential differences between sex and age groups. All AMI hospitalizations (ICD9 410; ICD10 I21, I22) and coronary out-of-hospital deaths (ICD9 410-414; ICD10 I20-I25) in Norway for individuals ≥25 years were obtained during 1994-2009. Incident AMI was defined as a hospitalization or out-of-hospital death due to AMI with no prior hospitalization for AMI during the previous 7 years. Age-standardized and age-group specific rates were calculated and expressed per 100,000 persons. The annual changes in rates were obtained from Poisson regression analyses. The total change in incidence rates during 2001-2009 were then calculated based on the estimated annual change. We identified 148,522 incident AMIs (41% women; 21% out-of-hospital deaths) during 2001-2009. Incidence rates declined by 24% (incidence rate ratio, IRR, 0.76, 95% CI 0.75-0.78). Out-of-hospital death rates declined more than hospitalization rates (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.52-0.56 vs. IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82-0.85; p < 0.001). The decline in incidence rates was observed among those 45 years or older. Among persons under 45 years, AMI incidence rates did not change significantly, while hospitalization rates increased with 11%.",AMI incidence rates declined during 2001-2009.

Do synthetic inhibitors of CDKs induce different responses in androgen sensitive and androgen insensitive prostatic cancer cell lines?,"Because of the high prevalence of prostatic cancer and the limitations of its treatment, enormous effort has been put into the development of new therapeutic modalities. One potential tool is the use of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, which are based on the trisubstituted derivatives of purine. The aim of this study was to analyse alterations of the regulatory pathways in both androgen sensitive and androgen insensitive prostatic cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DU-145, respectively) after blockage of the cell cycle by the synthetic CDK inhibitors, olomoucine and bohemine. The effects of olomoucine and bohemine were studied on the following parameters: (1) cell proliferation, by measurement of DNA content; (2) viability, by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and/or XTT (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) test; and (3) the expression of p53, pRB, Bcl-2, Bax, p16, p21, p27, cyclins A, B, D1, E, p34(cdc2), and the androgen receptor (AR), by western blot analysis. Both olomoucine and bohemine were potent inhibitors of growth and viability; however, bohemine was two to three times more effective than olomoucine. The sensitivity of LNCaP cells to both agents was significantly higher. After treatment, both cell lines revealed quite different spectra of protein expression.","These results indicate the existence of specific cell cycle regulating pathways in both cell lines, which may be associated with both p53 and AR status. CDK inhibitors exhibited valuable secondary effects on the expression of numerous regulators and thus may modulate the responsiveness of tumour cells to treatment, including treatment with hormone antagonists.",closed_qa
Should imaging be a component of rheumatoid arthritis remission criteria?,"Patients can fulfil clinical criteria for remission, yet still have evidence of synovitis detectable clinically and by ultrasound, and this is associated with structural damage. Stricter remission criteria may more accurately reflect true remission (no synovitis). This hypothesis was examined by studying patients using more stringent thresholds for clinical remission and determining their levels of ultrasound synovitis. Rheumatoid arthritis patients with a disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) ≤2.6 for at least 6 months were classified using standard and more stringent DAS28 and simplified disease activity index (SDAI) remission thresholds and the corresponding clinical and ultrasound imaging measures of synovitis recorded. 128 patients (all DAS28<2.6, median DAS28 1.70) receiving either disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs alone (n=66) or with a tumour necrosis factor blocker (n=62) were recruited. Of the 640 imaged joints, 5% had moderate or severe power Doppler (PD) activity, 8% were clinically swollen and 1% tender. In patients fulfilling DAS28, American College of Rheumatology or SDAI remission criteria, moderate or severe PD activity was present in 21%, 15% and 19%, respectively. More stringent DAS28 and SDAI criteria reduced the mean number of swollen and tender joints (p<0.001) but not the percentage of patients with PD activity: 32 patients had a DAS28<1.17 but eight (25%) had significant PD activity.","Using more stringent remission criteria resulted in reduced signs and symptoms of inflammation, but the percentage of joints with PD activity was not reduced, even in those without signs or symptoms. These data suggest that clinical criteria are sufficiently insensitive to detect low but clinically relevant levels of inflammation accurately.",closed_qa
Does the effectiveness of webcast compared to live lecture as a teaching tool in medical school?,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether webcast lectures are comparable to live lectures as a teaching tool in medical school. Three Otolaryngology-Head&Neck Surgery (OTO-HNS) lectures were given to third year medical students through their regular academic curriculum with one group receiving lectures in a live lecture format and the other group in a webcast format. All lectures (live or webcast) were given by the same lecturer and contained identical material. Three outcome measures were used: a student satisfaction survey, performance on the OTO-HNS component of their written examination, and performance on an OTO-HNS OSCE station in the general end of year OSCE examination session. Students performance on the written examination was equal between the two groups. The webcast group outperformed the live lecture group in the OSCE station. The majority of students in the webcast group felt it was an effective learning tool for them. Most viewed the lectures more than once, and felt that this was beneficial to their learning.",Webcasts appear equally effective to live lectures as a teaching tool.,closed_qa
Do dithiolane analogs of lignans inhibit interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in macrophages?,"To investigate the effect of a group of novel synthetic dithiolane analogs of lignans and a well characterized platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, L659,989 on PAF-receptor binding, IFN-gamma- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production, and steady-state inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression. PAF-receptor binding study was performed by displacement of 3H-PAF from rabbit platelet membrane; NO production was quantitated by measuring the NO oxidation product, nitrite, in conditioned culture medium; expression of iNOS mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis. The dithiolane analogs inhibited the production of NO, decreased iNOS mRNA expression and antagonized PAF-receptor binding. L659,989 had no effect on NO production and iNOS mRNA expression. Among the compounds tested, there was no simple correlation between their PAF-receptor antagonistic and iNOS inhibitory activities.",The dithiolane analogs are a new synthetic chemical class of iNOS expression regulators with dual biologic functions: inhibiting iNOS induction and blocking PAF-receptor.,closed_qa
Do [ Oral language of children with five years of experience using [ corrected ] cochlear implant ]?,"Cochlear implant (CI) in children. 1) to delineate a profile of receptive and expressive verbal language of children who have been using cochlear implant for five years and five years and eleven months; 2) to verify the influence of time of auditory sensorial privation in the receptive and expressive verbal language of these children. 19 children users of CI with auditory deficiency acquired before language development, who have been using CI for 5y - 5y11m and who have an average time of sensorial privation of 3y (standard deviation of 1 year). These children were assessed using the Reynell Developmental Scales (RDLS) (Reynell e Gruber, 1990) which is composed of: Comprehension Scale (C), Expression Scale (E) and its Structure Sub-Scales (Es), Vocabulary (Ev) and Content (Ec). The median values and the values found for quartile 75 and quartile 25 were: .44, 57 and 54 for C; 48, 60 and 55 for E; 20, 21 and 20 for Es; 15, 19 and 17 for Ev; 15, 22 and 18 for Ec; 96, 116 and 108 for the total score. A statistical correlation between the time of sensorial privation and the score obtained for C (p=- 0.62; R=0.0044) and Ec (p=-0.48; R=0.0348) was observed. Therefore the time of sensorial privation had an influence on the overall score (p=- 0.53; R=0.0174).","The language profile of children who use CI for five years is devious and similar to that of five year old hearing children regarding Expression and to that of four year old hearing regarding Comprehension; time of sensorial privation was statistically significant for the score obtained in C--receptive language--and for the score obtained in the E section (Ec)--expressive language, as well as in the overall score of RDLS.",closed_qa
Does aNGPTL-4 correlate with vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy?,"To investigate the relationship between angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL-4) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the serum and vitreous of eyes in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Thirty-five eyes of 35 patients with PDR, 20 eyes of 20 patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 20 eyes of 20 patients with diabetes but no diabetic retinopathy, and 14 eyes of 14 nondiabetic patients with an idiopathic macular hole (IMH) were recruited from Shanghai First People's Hospital. The ANGPTL-4 and VEGF concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Group means were compared using one-way analysis of variance with GraphPad Prism 4.0 and SPSS ver. 17.0. The research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The ANGPTL-4 and VEGF levels were significantly higher in the vitreous and serum of patients with PDR compared with patients with IMH. There were significant correlations between the ANGPTL-4 and VEGF levels in the vitreous and serum of patients with PDR. The vitreous and serum ANGPTL-4 levels were also significantly correlated in patients with PDR. The ANGPTL-4 in both the vitreous and serum correlated with the serum triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.",The ANGPTL-4 levels were markedly elevated and the ANGPTL-4 expression was directly correlated with the VEGF expression in the vitreous and serum of patients with PDR. The vitreous and serum ANGPTL-4 levels were also significantly correlated with serum lipids in patients with PDR. Our results suggest that the ANGPTL-4 may be used as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of PDR.,closed_qa
Does a simple gait-stabilizing device reduce outdoor falls and nonserious injurious falls in fall-prone older people during the winter?,"To determine whether Yaktrax Walker (YW), a nonmedical gait-stabilizing device, prevents outdoor falls and injurious falls in fall-prone older people during the winter. Prospective, randomized, interventional trial. Community-based, northern United States, winter, outdoors. Ambulatory, community-dwelling, fall-prone people aged 65 and older. Participants were randomized to wear YW or their usual winter footwear (UWF) outdoors during the winter of 2003/2004. The number of indoor and outdoor slips, falls, and injurious falls was recorded daily in a fall diary. Winter footwear satisfaction survey was completed after study completion. One hundred nine subjects completed 10,724 diary days. Mean age was 74.2. There were 93 indoor slips, 13 indoor falls, 714 outdoor slips, and 62 outdoor falls. The tendency for both groups to slip/fall indoors was comparable. The relative risk (RR) of outdoor slip for YW was 0.50 (P<.04) for all diary days and 0.61 (P=.14) when only days walked on snow and ice was the exposure variable. The RR of outdoor fall for YW was 0.42 (P<.03) when only days walked on snow and ice was the exposure variable. RR of injurious falls per day walked on snow and ice for YW was 0.13 (P<.02). Twelve of 19 outdoor falls occurred when YW subjects were not wearing their assigned device. No serious injury or fracture occurred in either group. The number needed to treat for the YW to prevent one nonserious injurious fall in one winter was six.","YW may reduce the risk of outdoor winter falls, and of nonserious injurious falls, in older community-dwelling people with a history of previous falls.",closed_qa
Are changes in cortical cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix gene expression in prostate cancer related to oncogenic ERG deregulation?,"The cortical cytoskeleton network connects the actin cytoskeleton to various membrane proteins, influencing cell adhesion, polarity, migration and response to extracellular signals. Previous studies have suggested changes in the expression of specific components in prostate cancer, especially of 4.1 proteins (encoded by EPB41 genes) which form nodes in this network. Expression of EPB41L1, EPB41L2, EPB41L3 (protein: 4.1B), EPB41L4B (EHM2), EPB41L5, EPB49 (dematin), VIL2 (ezrin), and DLG1 (summarized as ""cortical cytoskeleton"" genes) as well as ERG was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in a well-characterized set of 45 M0 prostate adenocarcinoma and 13 benign tissues. Hypermethylation of EPB41L3 and GSTP1 was compared in 93 cancer tissues by methylation-specific PCR. Expression of 4.1B was further studied by immunohistochemistry. EPB41L1 and EPB41L3 were significantly downregulated and EPB41L4B was upregulated in cancer tissues. Low EPB41L1 or high EPB41L4B expression were associated with earlier biochemical recurrence. None of the other cortical cytoskeleton genes displayed expression changes, in particular EPB49 and VIL2, despite hints from previous studies. EPB41L3 downregulation was significantly associated with hypermethylation of its promoter and strongly correlated with GSTP1 hypermethylation. Protein 4.1B was detected most strongly in the basal cells of normal prostate epithelia. Its expression in carcinoma cells was similar to the weaker one in normal luminal cells. EPB41L3 downregulation and EPB41L4B upregulation were essentially restricted to the 22 cases with ERG overexpression. Expression changes in EPB41L3 and EPB41L4B closely paralleled those previously observed for the extracellular matrix genes FBLN1 and SPOCK1, respectively.",Specific changes in the cortical cytoskeleton were observed during prostate cancer progression. They parallel changes in the expression of extracellular matrix components and all together appear to be associated with oncogenic ERG overexpression. We hypothesize that these alterations may contribute to the increased invasivity conferred to prostate cancer cells by ERG deregulation.,closed_qa
Is expansion of CD60 helper lymphocytes detected in peripheral lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals paralleled in lymph nodes?,"A significant expansion of CD8 cells with capability of Th2 type helper function had been observed in hemophiliacs with HIV infection. These cells were characterised by the surface co-expression of CD8 and CD60 antigen. Our objective was to investigate this lymphocyte subset in relation to other subsets in homosexuals and drug users in two compartments: blood and lymph nodes. Blood and lymph nodes from not HIV-infected persons served as control. CD8+CD60+ cells were expanded in perpheral blood of HIV - infected patients as compared to age matched controls (10.0 versus 4.1%, p <0.05). This difference was not observed in lymph node cell suspensions (6.2 vs. 4.3% of all lymph node cells; p = n.s.). The CD 4/CD8 ratio was significantly less impaired in lymph nodes than in blood (2.27 vs. 0.83; p <0.05). Cytotoxic T cells were more abundant in the lymph nodes of patients with early stage HIV disease when compared two late stage patients (4.3 vs 2.1%; p <0.05). Immunohistochemistry on frozen lymph node cuts showed presence of CD60 cells mainly in the interfollicular and paracortical area. In 3 of 10 HIV infected patients these cells were also found in the germinal centers. In controls no CD60 cells were detected in the follicles. Numbers and percentages of CD60 cellls and CD8+CD60+ cells in blood and in lymph nodes did not correlate with HIV - stage, CD4 count or plasma viral load. No correlation with lymph node viral load was seen.","Our data confirm that like in hemophiliacs expansion of CD8+CD60+ is also found in the blood of other HIV risk groups and seems not to be specific for hemophiliacs. However, the higher percentage in peripheral blood is not paralleled in lymph nodes. Redistribution phenomena seem to be the most plausible explanation. According to these data, a major impact of CD8+CD60+ cells in the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection does not seem likely.",closed_qa
Do benefit of a contralateral routing of signal device for unilateral cochlear implant users?,"To investigate objective and subjective effects of an adjunctive contralateral routing of signal (CROS) device at the untreated ear in patients with a unilateral cochlear implant (CI). Prospective study of 10 adult experienced unilateral CI users with bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss. Speech in noise reception (SNR) and sound localization were measured with and without the additional CROS device. SNR was measured by applying speech signals at the untreated/CROS side while noise signals came from the front (S90N0). For S0N90, signal sources were switched. Sound localization was measured in a 12-loudspeaker full circle setup. To evaluate the subjective benefit, patients tried the device for 2 weeks at home, then filled out the abbreviated Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale as well as the Bern benefit in single-sided deafness questionnaires. In the setting S90N0, all patients showed a highly significant SNR improvement when wearing the additional CROS device (mean 6.4 dB, p < 0.001). In the unfavorable setting S0N90, only a minor deterioration of speech understanding was noted (mean -0.66 dB, p = 0.54). Sound localization did not improve substantially with CROS. In the two questionnaires, 12 of 14 items showed an improvement in mean values, but none of them was statistically significant.","Patients with unilateral CI benefit from a contralateral CROS device, particularly in a noisy environment, when speech comes from the CROS ear side.",closed_qa
Does caspase-3 knock-down reverse contractile dysfunction induced by sepsis in adult rat ventricular myocytes?,"The present study tested the hypothesis that selective caspase-3 (C-3) knock-out would regulate the contractile actions of noradrenaline (NA) in the dysfunction of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) induced by sepsis. Here, we have studied the contractile response of ARVMs, transfected with C-3 small interfering RNA (C-3 siRNA), to NA. Single ARVMs were isolated from the hearts of male Sprague-Dawley rats 3 days after induction of sepsis, and from sham-treated rats. The sham and septic ARVMs were treated with NA (10 microM) alone or after transfection with C-3 siRNA or non-silencing RNA (2 microM). Mechanical properties were measured digitally, and immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analyses were carried out. The NA-induced increase in peak shortening (PS) was less in septic ARVMs and transfection with C-3 siRNA produced a significant increase in this PS. Immunocytochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed that NA exacerbated sepsis-induced up-regulation of C-3. Transfection of septic ARVMs with C-3 siRNA exhibited a decreased expression of C-3 fluorescence after NA. In septic ARVMs, we also observed a down-regulation of contractile proteins (alpha-actin, myosin light chain-1 and tropomyosin) along with DNA damage. Transfection of septic ARVMs with C-3 siRNA produced an increase in the expression of contractile proteins, and a decrease in DNA damage.","These data suggest that C-3 knock-down improved the loss of contractile response to NA in septic ARVMs, suggesting that C-3 regulated contractile dysfunction induced by sepsis in ARVMs.",closed_qa
Wilms tumour in Malawi: surgical staging to stratify postoperative chemotherapy?,"Wilms tumour postoperative chemotherapy is ideally stratified according to the pathologist's assessment of tumour stage and risk classification (tumour type). In sub-Saharan Africa results are often not available in time to influence therapy and in Malawi surgical staging has been used to stratify postoperative chemotherapy. Here we compare the results from surgical and both local pathology and central pathology review. Children diagnosed with a Wilms tumour in Blantyre, Malawi between 2007 and 2011 were included if they had a nephrectomy and the pathology slides were available. All tumour specimens were assessed in three different ways: the local surgeon documented the surgical stage of the tumour, and the risk classification and pathology stage were assessed both by the local pathologist and by a SIOP central review pathologist in Europe. Fifty patients had complete data available and were included in the analyses. Tumour risk classification differed between the local and central pathology review in only two patients (4%). Using central pathology review as the gold standard 60% of patients received the correct postoperative chemotherapy treatment based on surgical staging and 84% based on the local pathology stage and risk classification.",Local pathology capacity building is needed to enable timely assessment and reporting.,closed_qa
Does baroreflex sensitivity predict long-term cardiovascular mortality after myocardial infarction even in patients with preserved left ventricular function?,"This study sought to assess the long-term predictive power of depressed baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with preserved left ventricular function. Risk stratification after MI is primarily performed by identifying patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) because of their greater mortality. Autonomic markers can help refining risk stratification. Depressed BRS (<3 ms/mm Hg) correlated with cardiovascular mortality in 1,284 post-MI patients during a 21-month follow-up in the multicenter ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction) study, but had no significant predictive power in patients with LVEF >35% or above age 65 years. Two hundred forty-four consecutive post-MI patients (age 59 +/- 10 years) with LVEF >35% (average 54 +/- 8%) were enrolled. They underwent a complete assessment, including BRS 4 weeks after MI. During a 5-year mean follow-up, 14 (5.7%) patients died of cardiovascular causes. Multivariate analysis identified BRS (p = 0.0001), but not LVEF and age, as predictive of cardiovascular mortality. The relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) for depressed BRS was 11.4 (95% CI 3.3 to 39.0) for the overall population, 19.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 94.8) for patients </=65 years, and 7.2 (95% CI 1.3 to 39.9) for patients above age 65.","Even among the large number of low-risk post-MI patients with preserved left ventricular function, depressed BRS identifies, independently of age, a subgroup at long-term high risk for cardiovascular mortality in which more aggressive preventive strategies should be considered.",closed_qa
Does intermittent Pneumatic Compression enhance Formation of Edema Tissue Fluid Channels in Lymphedema of Lower Limbs?,"In lymphedema, tissue fluid steadily accumulates in the subcutaneous space containing loose connective tissue. We documented previously that deformation of the structure of subcutaneous collagen bundles and fat by excess fluid leads to formation of ""lakes"" and interconnected channels with irregular shape. Since there is no force that could mobilize and propel stagnant fluid to the regions where lymphatics absorb and contract, this task should be taken over by external massage. The most effective in this respect seems to be the sequential intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). The aim of the study was to observe whether IPC would enhance and accelerate formation of tissue fluid channels. Together with the Biocompression Systems (Moonachie, NJ), we designed a high pressure intermittent compression device and used in it our therapy protocol for patients with obstructive lymphedema of lower limbs. The study was carried out on 18 patients with lymphedema stages II-IV. The IPC was applied daily for 1-2 hours. The follow up time was 24-36 months. Lymphoscintigraphy and immunohistopathology of tissue biopsies were used for evaluation of channel formation process. The forced fluid flow brought about increase of the area of fluid channels in the thigh and groin, with a decrease in the calf. Concomitantly, with decrease of channel area in the calf, there was a decrease of calf circumference. No new lymphatic collectors were observed.",Compression of limb lymphedema tissues leads to formation of tissue channels as pathways for evacuation of edema fluid.,closed_qa
Do long-term prescription of α-blockers decrease the risk of recurrent urolithiasis needed for surgical intervention-a nationwide population-based study?,"α1 receptors and subtypes have been confirmed to distribute in human pelvis and calyces recently. As used in ureteral stones, α-blocker treatment may facilitate kidney stone passage and long-term prescription of α-blocker may decrease the risk of recurrent urolithiasis. The aim of this study is to determine if use of α-blockers 180 days or more can decrease the risk of recurrent urolithiasis needed for surgical intervention. A representative database of 1,000,000 patients from Taiwan's National Health Insurance was analyzed. Eligible patients were those who had received the first-time procedure for upper urinary stone removal, including extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy, or both, between 2000 and 2010. After completing a 180-day treatment for first event, patients were prospectively followed-up until a second set of stone procedures was performed (proxy of stone recurrence), loss to follow-up, or end of study. The effect of percentage of total number of days of α-blocker use on need for second set of stone procedures within a post treatment 180-day follow-up period was analyzed by quartile. A nested case-control study was also performed. 1,259 patients were eligible for final analyses. During 3,980 person-years follow-up, 167 patients had recurrent urolithiasis needed for surgical intervention. From first to fourth quartile of drug exposure, recurrence rates were 45.64, 47.19, 43.11, and 18.52 per 1,000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.46 (95% CI = 0.24 to 0.89) for the fourth quartile (vs. quartile 1). In the nested case-control study, adjusted ORs was 0.23 (95% CI = 0.10 to 0.53) in the fourth quartile (vs. quartile 1).

Does change in urethral sphincter neuromuscular function during pregnancy persist after delivery?,"The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of pregnancy and first vaginal delivery on urethral striated sphincter neuromuscular function. Quantitative electromyographic (EMG) interference pattern analysis of the urethral sphincter of 23 nulligravidas and 31 third trimester primigravidas allowed comparison of mean motor unit parameters before term vaginal delivery and postpartum. Mean electromyographic interference pattern parameters in the primigravidas were significantly lower than nulligravidas even antepartum, with decreased turns, lower amplitude, and less activity. The only significant change at 6 months' postpartum was further decline in number of turns resulting in a further decrease in turns:amplitude. All other electromyographic abnormalities persisted at 6 months' postpartum and remained abnormal compared to the nulligravidas.",Urethral sphincter neuromuscular function changed significantly during pregnancy and these changes persisted postpartum.

Is there a gender bias in recommendations for further rehabilitation in primary care of patients with chronic pain after an interdisciplinary team assessment?,"To examine potential gender bias in recommendations of further examination and rehabilitation in primary care for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain after an interdisciplinary team assessment. The population consisted of consecutive patients (n = 589 women, 262 men) referred during a 3-year period from primary healthcare for assessment by interdisciplinary teams at a pain specialist rehabilitation clinic. Patient data were collected from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation. The outcome was defined as the examination or rehabilitation that was specified in the patient's record. Men had a significantly higher likelihood than women of being recommended physiotherapy and radiological examination, and the gender difference was not explained by confounding variables and covariates (age, marital status, ethnicity, education, working status, pain severity, pain interference, pain sites, anxiety and depression). There was no significant gender difference in recommendations to treatment by specialist physician, occupational therapist, psychologist or social worker.","Our findings indicate that the interdisciplinary teams in specialist healthcare may discriminate against women with chronic pain when physiotherapy and radiological investigation are recommended. The team's choice of recommendations might be influenced by gendered attitudes, but this field of research needs to be studied further.",closed_qa
Are GAF scores reliable in routine clinical use?,"The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale has been considered as a reliable tool. However, most studies of GAF reliability have been based on special conditions, such as prior training and test awareness. This study takes a different approach investigating inter-rater reliability of GAF scores in a routine clinical context. Eighty-two consecutively admitted acute psychiatric patients were rated according to routine department procedures and by two researchers at admission and discharge. Intraclass correlations (ICC) were computed using two-way mixed models. Inter-rater reliability between routine scores and research scores were low (ICC coefficients between r = 0.39 and 0.59). Inter-rater reliability between the two researchers were excellent (ICC coefficients r = 0.81 and 0.85).",Inter-rater reliability of GAF scores in a routine clinical context seems to be insufficient.,closed_qa
Can first responders be sent to selected 9-1-1 emergency medical services calls without an ambulance?,"To evaluate the feasibility and safety of initially dispatching only first responders (FRs) to selected low-risk 9-1-1 requests for emergency medical services. First responders are rapidly-responding fire crews on apparatus without transport capabilities, with firefighters trained to at least a FR level and in most cases to the basic emergency medical technician (EMT) level. Low-risk 9-1-1 requests include automatic medical alerts (ALERTs), motor vehicle incidents (MVIs) for which the caller was unable to answer any medical dispatch questions designed to prioritize the call, and 9-1-1 call disconnects (D/Cs). A before-and-after study of patient dispositions was conducted using historical controls for comparison. During the historical control phase of six months, one year prior to the study phase, basic life support ambulances (staffed with two basic EMTs) were dispatched to selected low-risk 9-1-1 incidents. During the six-month study phase, a fire FR crew equipped with automated external defibrillators (AEDs) was sent initially without an ambulance to these incidents. For ALERTs (n = 290 in historical group vs. 330 in study group), there was no statistical difference in the transport rate (7% vs 10%), but there was a statistically significant increase in the follow-up use of advanced life support (ALS) (1% vs 4%, p = 0.009). No patient in the ALERTs historical group required airway management, while one patient in the study group received endotracheal intubation. No patient required defibrillation in either group. Analysis of the MVIs showed a significant decrease (p<0.0001) in the patient transport rate from 39% of controls to 33% of study patients, but no change in the follow-up use of ALS interventions (2% for each group). For both the ALERTs and MVIs, the FR's mean response time was faster than ambulances (p<0.0001). Among the 9-1-1 D/Cs with FRs only (n = 1,028), 15% were transported and 43 (4%) received subsequent ALS care. Four of these patients (0.4%) received intubation and two (0.2%) required defibrillation. However, no patient was judged to have had adverse outcomes as a result of the dispatch protocol change.","Fire apparatus crews trained in the use of AEDs can safely be used to initially respond alone (without ambulances) to selected, low-risk 9-1-1 calls. This tactic improves response intervals while reducing ambulance responses to these incidents.",closed_qa
Do chromosomal and microRNA expression patterns reveal biologically distinct subgroups of 11q- neuroblastoma?,"The purpose of this study was to further define the biology of the 11q- neuroblastoma tumor subgroup by the integration of array-based comparative genomic hybridization with microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling data to determine if improved patient stratification is possible. A set of primary neuroblastoma (n = 160), which was broadly representative of all genetic subtypes, was analyzed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and for the expression of 430 miRNAs. A 15-miRNA expression signature previously shown to be predictive of clinical outcome was used to analyze an independent cohort of 11q- tumors (n = 37). Loss of 4p and gain of 7q occurred at a significantly higher frequency in the 11q- tumors, further defining the genetic characteristics of this subtype. The 11q- tumors could be split into two subgroups using a miRNA expression survival signature that differed significantly in clinical outcome and the overall frequency of large-scale genomic imbalances, with the poor survival subgroup having significantly more imbalances. miRNAs from the expression signature, which were upregulated in unfavorable tumors, were predicted to target downregulated genes from a published mRNA expression classifier of clinical outcome at a higher-than-expected frequency, indicating the miRNAs might contribute to the regulation of genes within the signature.","We show that two distinct biological subtypes of neuroblastoma with loss of 11q occur, which differ in their miRNA expression profiles, frequency of segmental imbalances, and clinical outcome. A miRNA expression signature, combined with an analysis of segmental imbalances, provides greater prediction of event-free survival and overall survival outcomes than 11q status by itself, improving patient stratification.",closed_qa
Does ghrelin mediate the somatotroph and corticotroph responses to the stimulatory effect of glucagon or insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in humans?,"Acylated ghrelin, a gastric peptide, possesses a potent GH- but also significant ACTH/cortisol-releasing activity mediated by the activation of GH secretagogue receptors (GHS-R) at the hypothalamus-pituitary level. The physiological role of ghrelin in the control of somatotroph and corticotroph function is, however, largely unclear. Glucagon is known to induce a clear increase of GH, ACTH and cortisol levels in humans, at least after intramuscular administration. In fact, glucagon is considered to be a classical alternative to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (ITT) for the combined evaluation of the function of GH and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We aimed to clarify whether ghrelin mediate the GH and corticotroph responses to intramuscular glucagon or ITT, which has recently been reported able to induce a surprising ghrelin decrease. To this aim we enrolled six normal young male subjects [age (mean +/- SD): 29.0 +/- 8.0 years, body mass index (BMI) 21.9 +/- 2.5 kg/m(2)]. In all the subjects we studied ghrelin, GH, ACTH, cortisol and glucose levels after glucagon (GLU; 0.017 mg/kg intramuscularly), ITT (0.1 IU/kg insulin intravenously) or saline administration. Saline infusion was not followed by any significant variation in ghrelin, GH and glucose levels while ACTH and cortisol showed the expected spontaneous morning trend toward a decrease. GLU administration increased (P < 0.01) circulating GH, ACTH and cortisol as well as insulin and glucose levels. ITT induced an obvious increase (P < 0.01) of GH, ACTH and cortisol levels. The ITT-induced increases in GH and ACTH, but not cortisol, levels were higher (P < 0.01) than those after GLU. Circulating ghrelin levels were not modified by GLU. On the other hand, ghrelin levels underwent a transient reduction (P < 0.01) after insulin-induced hypoglycaemia.","Ghrelin does not mediate the GH and ACTH responses to glucagon or to the ITT. In fact, ghrelin levels are not modified at all by glucagon and transiently decrease during the ITT. These findings support the assumption that ghrelin does not play a major role in the physiological control of somatotroph and corticotroph function.",closed_qa
Does serum HCV RNA titer at the end of interferon therapy predict the long-term outcome of treatment?,"Serum HCV RNA was quantitated by the competitive polymerase chain reaction before, at the end of, and after interferon therapy. We assessed whether serum HCV RNA titer at the end of interferon therapy predicts the long-term outcome of treatment. Of 71 patients treated with various doses of interferons, 21 became negative for HCV RNA persistently during follow up of 2 years, and they were considered as complete responders. The serial determinations of HCV RNA titer for each individual showed that in patients with HCV RNA negative at the end of therapy, the complete response rate was quite high (78.6%), while in patients with HCV RNA titer > or = 10(4) copies/ml at the end of therapy, none became complete responders in long-term follow up. The percentage decreasing to < or = 10(2) copies/ml of HCV RNA at termination of interferon tended to be higher in patients with genotype 2a (14/21, 66.7%) than in those with genotype 1b (18/42, 42.9%). The complete response rate of patients whose viral load was < or = 10(2) copies/ml at termination of interferon was significantly higher in genotype 2a (11/14, 78.6%) than in genotype 1b (5/18, 27.8%) (p < 0.01). Pretreatment HCV RNA titer appeared to correlate to the titer at the end of therapy (r = 0.596, p < 0.001); even when HCV RNA decreased to < or = 10(2) copies/ml, the higher pretreatment titer indicated a lower likelihood of complete response (p < 0.05).","These results indicate that HCV genotype and pretreatment viral titer are important factors in the response to interferon therapy. In addition, our study suggests that it is possible to stop interferon therapy at an appropriate time by monitoring HCV RNA titer.",closed_qa
Does oral Vaccination with Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium-Delivered TsPmy DNA Vaccine elicit Protective Immunity against Trichinella spiralis in BALB/c Mice?,"Our previous studies showed that Trichinella spiralis paramyosin (TsPmy) is an immunomodulatory protein that inhibits complement C1q and C8/C9 to evade host complement attack. Vaccination with recombinant TsPmy protein induced protective immunity against T. spiralis larval challenge. Due to the difficulty in producing TsPmy as a soluble recombinant protein, we prepared a DNA vaccine as an alternative approach in order to elicit a robust immunity against Trichinella infection. The full-length TsPmy coding DNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pVAX1, and the recombinant pVAX1/TsPmy was transformed into attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain SL7207. Oral vaccination of mice with this attenuated Salmonella-delivered TsPmy DNA vaccine elicited a significant mucosal sIgA response in the intestine and a systemic IgG antibody response with IgG2a as the predominant subclass. Cytokine analysis also showed a significant increase in the Th1 (IFN-γ, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, 5, 6, 10) responses in lymphocytes from the spleen and MLNs of immunized mice upon stimulation with TsPmy protein. The expression of the homing receptors CCR9/CCR10 on antibody secreting B cells may be related to the translocation of IgA-secreted B cells to local intestinal mucosa. The mice immunized with Salmonella-delivered TsPmy DNA vaccine produced a significant 44.8% reduction in adult worm and a 46.6% reduction in muscle larvae after challenge with T. spiralis larvae.",Our results demonstrated that oral vaccination with TsPmy DNA delivered by live attenuated S. typhimurium elicited a significant local IgA response and a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response that elicited a significant protection against T. spiralis infection in mice.,closed_qa
Does gDNF induce recovery of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in the rat brain following intracerebroventricular or intraparenchymal administration?,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been shown to be a survival and neuroprotective factor for nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in vivo. The present study was designed to investigate the possible neuroprotective and restorative role by GDNF for dopaminergic neurons which were exposed to the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). We compared neurochemical, morphological and behavioural changes following striatal infusion of GDNF to those following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion. Apomorphine-induced rotation showed significant recovery after both types of infusion. Significant recovery of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive (IR) neurons and fibers were found in the substantia nigra and striatum following both striatum and i.c.v. infusion except for the number of TH-IR neurons in the i.c.v. infusion group.","These results suggest that GDNF induces recovery of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and this indicates a potential usefulness of GDNF for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",closed_qa
Does inhibition of neutrophil migration by hemopexin lead to increased mortality due to sepsis in mice?,"The reduction of neutrophil migration to the bacterial focus is associated with poor outcome in sepsis. The objective of this study was to identify soluble substances in the blood of septic mice that inhibit neutrophil migration. A pool of serum obtained from mice 2 hours after the induction of severe sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture inhibited the neutrophil migration. The proteins with inhibitory activity on neutrophil migration were isolated by Blue-Sepharose chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electrophoresis, and identified by mass spectrometry. Hemopexin was identified as the serum component responsible for the inhibition of neutrophil migration. In sepsis, the pretreatment of wild-type mice with hemopexin inhibited neutrophil migration to the focus of infection and decreased the survival rate from 87.5 to 50.0%. Hemopexin-null mice subjected to severe sepsis presented normal neutrophil migration, low bacteremia, and an improvement of 40% in survival rate. Moreover, hemopexin inhibited the neutrophil chemotaxis response evoked by C5a or macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and induced a reduction of CXCR2 and L-selectin as well as the up-regulation of CD11b expression in neutrophil membranes. The inhibitory effect of hemopexin on neutrophil chemotaxis was prevented by serine protease inhibitors or ATP. In addition, serum levels of ATP were decreased 2 hours after severe sepsis.",These data demonstrate for the first time the inhibitory role of hemopexin in neutrophil migration during sepsis and suggest that the therapeutic inhibition of hemopexin or its protease activity could improve neutrophil migration to the focus of infection and survival in sepsis.,closed_qa
"Is thymidine phosphorylase expression associated with time to progression in patients receiving low-dose , docetaxel-modulated capecitabine for metastatic breast cancer?","Preclinical data have indicated a synergistic interaction between docetaxel and capecitabine by means of taxane-induced up-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase (TP). On the basis of such premises, we conducted a phase II trial to determine the activity and tolerability of weekly docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Furthermore, we explored the relationship between TP tumor expression and benefit from this regimen. Patients received docetaxel 36 mg/m(2) i.v. on days 1, 8, and 15 and capecitabine orally 625 mg/m(2) b.i.d. from days 8 to 21. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. In the correlative study, we evaluated the TP expression by immunohistochemistry and the TP messenger RNA expression by real-time RT-PCR in the primary tumor. Forty-seven women were enrolled. In the intention-to-treat analysis, objective responses were achieved in 24 patients (51%). Fourteen additional patients (30%) had stable disease. The median time to progression (TTP) was 6 months (range 1-44 months). Median survival was 17 months (range 1-48 months). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated. The most common clinical adverse events (all grades) were alopecia (55%), nail changes (53%), fatigue/asthenia (51%), nausea/vomiting (51%), neutropenia (49%), and neuropathy (49%). A significantly higher TTP was observed in patients with TP-positive tumors (log-rank test, P = 0.009). Interestingly, a subgroup analysis confirmed this TTP benefit in patients with TP-positive tumors obtaining a tumor response (log-rank test, P = 0.03), whereas the statistical significance was lost in nonresponders (log-rank test, P = 0.3).",This study indicates that a regimen with low doses of capecitabine plus weekly docetaxel is active against MBC. The correlative analysis provides preliminary evidence that TP expression may be a predictive marker for therapeutic benefit.,closed_qa
Do gABA and valproate modulate trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission in the thalamus?,"To study the role of GABA receptors in thalamic relay neurons in the ventroposteromedial (VPM) nucleus of the rat activated by a trigeminovascular nociceptive stimulus in relationship to migraine, and the potential modulation of nociceptive transmission by GABA acting anti-convulsants. Trigeminovascular nociceptive afferents were identified in the VPM by electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), and cell bodies identified by activation with L-glutamate. The effect of GABA, valproate and gabapentin ejection during SSS stimulation and microiontophoresis of L-glutamate was studied. GABA responses were characterized with the selective GABA(A) and GABA(B) agonists muscimol and baclofen, respectively, and the antagonists bicuculline (GABA(A)) and hydroxysaclofen (GABA(B)). GABA inhibited the response to SSS stimulation and L-glutamate ejection. Both the selective GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, and the GABA(B) agonist baclofen strongly inhibited the post-synaptic response to L-glutamate. This inhibition could be antagonised by co-ejection of the appropriate antagonist. The post-synaptic inhibitory action of GABA on the cell bodies of third order neurons could be partially antagonised by co-ejection of bicuculline but not by hydroxysaclofen. Valproate inhibited the responses to SSS stimulation and L-glutamate ejection. Bicuculline, but not hydroxysaclofen, was able to antagonise the effect of valproate on both responses to L-glutamate and SSS stimulation. Gabapentin did not alter the responses to L-glutamate and SSS stimulation.","These results indicate that GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors on thalamic neurons can modulate trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission in the VPM nucleus. Sodium valproate can inhibit trigeminovascular nociception at the level of VPM through GABA(A) receptor mechanisms, whereas gabapentin does not alter trigeminovascular nociception.",closed_qa
Does interleukin-1 receptor antagonist modulate the early phase of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in mice?,"Cytokine administration is a potential therapy for acute liver failure by reducing inflammatory responses and favour hepatocyte regeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) during liver regeneration and to study the effect of a recombinant human IL-1ra on liver regeneration. We performed 70%-hepatectomy in wild type (WT) mice, IL-1ra knock-out (KO) mice and in WT mice treated by anakinra. We analyzed liver regeneration at regular intervals by measuring the blood levels of cytokines, the hepatocyte proliferation by bromodeoxyuridin (BrdU) incorporation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Cyclin D1 expression. The effect of anakinra on hepatocyte proliferation was also tested in vitro using human hepatocytes. At 24h and at 48 h after hepatectomy, IL-1ra KO mice had significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and MCP-1) and a reduced and delayed hepatocyte proliferation measured by BrdU incorporation, PCNA and Cyclin D1 protein levels, when compared to WT mice. IGFBP-1 and C/EBPβ expression was significantly decreased in IL-1ra KO compared to WT mice. WT mice treated with anakinra showed significantly decreased levels of IL-6 and significantly higher hepatocyte proliferation at 24h compared to untreated WT mice. In vitro, primary human hepatocytes treated with anakinra showed significantly higher proliferation at 24h compared to hepatocytes without treatment.",IL1ra modulates the early phase of liver regeneration by decreasing the inflammatory stress and accelerating the entry of hepatocytes in proliferation. IL1ra might be a therapeutic target to improve hepatocyte proliferation.,closed_qa
Surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma: does it improve survival?,"The incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are increasing in the United States. Whether surgery is associated with improved survival at the population level is relatively unknown. To address this question, we used a population-based cancer registry to compare survival outcomes between patients receiving and not receiving surgery with similar tumor sizes and health status. By using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified HCC patients who had surgically resectable disease as defined by published expert guidelines. After excluding patients with contraindications to surgery, we performed both survival analysis and Cox regression to identify predictors of improved survival. Of the 4008 patients diagnosed with HCC between 1988 and 1998, 417 were candidates for surgical resection. The mean age was 63.6 years; mean tumor size was 3.3 cm. The 5-year overall survival with surgery was 33% with a mean of 47.1 months; without surgery, the 5-year overall survival was 7% with a mean of 17.9 months (P<.001). In the multivariate Cox regression, surgery was significantly associated with improved survival (P<.001). Specifically, patients who received surgery had a 55% decreased rate of death compared with patients who did not have surgery, even after controlling for tumor size, age, sex, and race.","This study shows that surgical therapy is associated with improved survival in patients with unifocal, nonmetastatic HCC tumors<5 cm. If this is confirmed in future studies, efforts should be made to ensure that appropriate patients with resectable HCC receive high-quality care, as well as the opportunity for potentially curative surgery.",closed_qa
Do deaf children with cochlear implants appear to use sentence context to help recognize spoken words?,"The authors investigated the ability of deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) to use sentence context to facilitate the perception of spoken words. Deaf children with CIs (n = 24) and an age-matched group of children with normal hearing (n = 31) were presented with lexically controlled sentences and were asked to repeat each sentence in its entirety. Performance was analyzed at each of 3 word positions of each sentence (first, second, and third key word). Whereas the children with normal hearing showed robust effects of contextual facilitation-improved speech perception for the final words in a sentence-the deaf children with CIs on average showed no such facilitation. Regression analyses indicated that for the deaf children with CIs, Forward Digit Span scores significantly predicted accuracy scores for all 3 positions, whereas performance on the Stroop Color and Word Test, Children's Version (Golden, Freshwater, & Golden, 2003) predicted how much contextual facilitation was observed at the final word.",The pattern of results suggests that some deaf children with CIs do not use sentence context to improve spoken word recognition. The inability to use sentence context may be due to possible interactions between language experience and cognitive factors that affect the ability to successfully integrate temporal-sequential information in spoken language.,closed_qa
Is there a role for axillary dissection for patients with operable breast cancer in this era of conservatism?,"The trend in breast cancer surgery is toward more conservative operative procedures. The new staging technique of sentinel node biopsy facilitates the identification of pathological node-negative patients in whom axillary dissection may be avoided. However, patients with a positive sentinel node biopsy would require a thorough examination of their nodal status. An axillary -dissection provides good local control, and accurate staging and prognostic information to inform decisions about adjuvant therapy. In addition, the survival benefit of axillary treatment is still debated. The objectives of the present study were to examine the pattern of lymph node metastases in the axilla, and evaluate the merits of a level III axillary dissection. Between June 1997 and May 2000, 308 patients underwent a total of 320 level III dissections as part of their treatment for operable invasive breast cancer. The three axillary levels were marked intraoperatively, and the contents in each level were submitted and examined separately. The patterns of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases were examined, and factors associated with>or =4 positive nodes, and level III ALN metastases were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. An average of 25 lymph nodes were examined per case (range: 8-54), and using strict anatomical criteria, the mean numbers of ALN found in levels I, II and III were 18 (range: 2-43), 4 (range: 0-19), and 3 (range: 0-11), respectively. Axillary lymph node involvement was found in 45% of the cases (143/320). Of the 143 cases, 78% (n = 111) had involvement of level I nodes only, and 21% (n = 30) had positive ALN in levels II and, or, III, in addition to level I. Involvement of lymph nodes in level II or III without a level I metastasis was found in two cases only (0.6%). By including level II, in addition to level I, in the dissection, four cases (1%) were converted from one to three positive nodes to>or =4 positive nodes (P = 0.64). By the inclusion of level III to a level I and II dissection, three cases (1%) were converted from one to three positive nodes to>or =4 positive nodes (P = 0.74). Involvement of lymph nodes in level III was found in 22 cases (7%), and 51 cases (16%) had>or =4 positive nodes. Palpability of ALN, pathological tumour size, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), were sig-nificantly associated with level III involvement and>or =4 positive nodes by univariate and multivariate analyses. The frequencies of level III involvement and>or =4 positive nodes in patients with palpable ALN were 22% and 42%, respectively. The corresponding frequencies in patients with a clinically negative axilla, and a primary tumour which was>20 mm and LVI positive, were over 14% and 31%, respectively.","Level III axillary dissection is appropriate for patients with palpable ALN, and in those with a tumour which is>20 mm and LVI positive, principally to reduce the risk of axillary recurrence. Staging accuracy is achieved with a level II dissection, or even a level I dissection alone based on strict anatomical criteria. Sentinel node biopsy is a promising technique in identifying pathological node-positive patients in whom an axillary clearance provides optimal local control and staging information.",closed_qa
Does kainic acid-induced albumin leak across the blood-brain barrier facilitate epileptiform hyperexcitability in limbic regions?,"Systemic administration of kainic acid (KA) is a widely used procedure utilized to develop a model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Despite its ability to induce status epilepticus (SE) in vivo, KA applied to in vitro preparations induces only interictal-like activity and/or isolated ictal discharges. The possibility that extravasation of the serum protein albumin from the vascular compartment enhances KA-induced brain excitability is investigated here. Epileptiform activity was induced by arterial perfusion of 6 μm KA in the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain preparation. Simultaneous field potential recordings were carried out bilaterally from limbic (CA1, dentate gyrus [DG], and entorhinal cortex) and extralimbic regions (piriform cortex and neocortex). Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown associated with KA-induced epileptiform activity was assessed by parenchymal leakage of intravascular fluorescein-isothiocyanate albumin. Seizure-induced brain inflammation was evaluated by western blot analysis of interleukin (IL)-1β expression in brain tissue. KA infusion caused synchronized activity at 15-30 Hz in limbic (but not extralimbic) cortical areas, associated with a brief, single seizure-like event. A second bolus of KA, 60 min after the induction of the first ictal event, did not further enhance excitability. Perfusion of serum albumin between the two administrations of KA enhanced epileptiform discharges and allowed a recurrent ictal event during the second KA infusion.","Our data show that arterial KA administration selectively alters the synchronization of limbic networks. However, KA is not sufficient to generate recurrent seizures unless serum albumin is co-perfused during KA administration. These findings suggest a role of serum albumin in facilitating acute seizure generation.",closed_qa
Are thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor and thyroid hormone receptors involved in human endometrial physiology?,"To study the expression, distribution, and function of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) and thyroid hormone receptors (TR) α1, α2, and β1 in human endometrium. Experimental clinical study. University hospital. 31 fertile women. Endometrial biopsy samples obtained throughout the menstrual cycle. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and Western blot to study the expression of TSHR, TRα1, TRα2, and TRβ1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins in human endometrium. We found TSHR, TRα1, TRα2 and TRβ1 mRNA and proteins expressed in human endometrium. Immunostaining for TSHR in the luminal epithelium and TRα1 and β1 in the glandular and luminal epithelium increased statistically significantly on luteinizing hormone (LH) days 6 to 9, coinciding with appearance of pinopodes. Endometrial stromal and Ishikawa cells expressed mRNA for TSHR, TR, and iodothyronine deiodinases 1-3. After 48 hours, TSH significantly increased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and LIF receptor (LIFR) messenger RNA (mRNA) in endometrial stromal cells, but decreased their expression in Ishikawa cells. Glucose transporter 1 mRNA was up-regulated by TSH in Ishikawa cells. We found that TSH statistically significantly increased secretion of free triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxin (T4) by Ishikawa cells compared with nonstimulated cells.",Thyroid hormones are directly involved in endometrial physiology.,closed_qa
Does phenazopyridine improve catheter discomfort following gynecologic surgery?,"We sought to determine if phenazopyridine improves pain in catheterized patients recovering from gynecologic surgery. This trial randomized 240 adult women, who were undergoing gynecologic surgery and requiring an indwelling Foley catheter, to placebo or phenazopyridine hydrochloride. Group assignment was masked by instillation of orange dye in the Foley bag of both groups. The primary outcome was the mean postoperative visual analog score (VAS). Secondary outcomes were pain medicine utilization and blinding efficacy. In all, 219 patients received study medications (112 phenazopyridine and 107 placebo). There was no significant difference in demographics, procedure type, bladder VAS, overall VAS, and pain medication use. Only 25 of the 45 participants who responded guessed their group assignment correctly, suggesting adequate blinding.",Postoperative VAS scores and pain medicine usage did not change with using routine phenazopyridine following gynecology surgery.

Does stunting mediate the Association between Small-for-Gestational-Age and Postneonatal Mortality?,"In sub-Saharan Africa, one-third of all births are small for gestational age (SGA), and 4.4 million children are stunted; both conditions increase the risk of child mortality. SGA has also been shown to increase the risk of stunting. We tested whether the association between SGA and postneonatal mortality is mediated by stunting. We used longitudinal data from children aged 6 wk to 24 mo (n = 12,155) enrolled in the ZVITAMBO (Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies) trial. HIV exposure was defined based on maternal HIV status at baseline. SGA was defined as birthweight <10th percentile of the INTERGROWTH-21st (International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century) standards. We used a standard mediation approach by comparing the attenuation of the risk when the mediator was added to the model. We used Cox proportional hazards models first to regress SGA on postneonatal mortality, controlling for age. Stunting (length-for-age z score <-2) was then included in the model to test mediation. Approximately 20% of children were term SGA, and 23% were stunted before their last follow-up visit. In this cohort, 31% of children were exposed to HIV; the HIV-exposed group represented a pooled group of HIV-infected and HIV-exposed but uninfected children. Postneonatal mortality was significantly higher among children born SGA (HR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.7). This association was attenuated and not statistically significant when stunting was included in the model, suggesting a mediation effect (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.3). When stratified by HIV exposure status, we observed a significant attenuation of the risk, suggesting mediation, only among HIV-exposed children (model 1, HR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.6; model 2, HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.3).",This analysis aids in investigating pathways that underlie an observed SGA-mortality relation and may inform survival interventions in undernourished settings.,closed_qa
Does foot cooling reduce exercise-induced hyperthermia in men with spinal cord injury?,"The number of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) participating in sports at recreational and elite levels is on the rise. However, loss of autonomic nervous system function below the lesion can compromise thermoregulatory capacity and increase the risk of heat stress relative to able-bodied (AB) individuals. To test the hypotheses that exercise in a heated environment would increase tympanic temperature (TTY) more in individuals with SCI than AB individuals, and that foot cooling using a new device would attenuate the rise in TTY during exercise in both groups. Six subjects with SCI (lesions C5-T5) and six AB controls were tested in a heated environment (means +/- SEM, temperature = 31.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C, humidity = 26 +/- 1%) for 45 min at 66% +/- 5 of arm cranking VO2peak and 30 min of recovery on two separate occasions with foot cooling (FC) or no foot cooling (NC) in randomized order. During exercise and recovery in both trials, SCI TTY was elevated above baseline (P < 0.001) but more so in the NC versus FC trial (1.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C vs 1.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C, respectively, P < 0.005). Within the AB group, TTY was elevated above baseline for both trials (P < 0.001) with peak increases of 0.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C and 0.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C for NC and FC, respectively. TTY, face, and back temperature were higher in both SCI trials compared with AB trials (P < 0.05). Heart rate during exercise and recovery was lower in the SCI FC versus SCI NC (P < 0.05).","These results suggest that extraction of heat through the foot may provide an effective way to manipulate tympanic temperature in individuals with SCI, especially during exercise in the heat.",closed_qa
Is chemotherapy necessary for patients with molar pregnancy and human chorionic gonadotropin serum levels raised but falling at 6months after uterine evacuation?,"To compare the outcomes of Brazilian patients with molar pregnancy who continue human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) surveillance with those treated with chemotherapy when hCG was still positive, but falling at 6months after uterine evacuation. Retrospective chart review of 12,526 patients with hydatidiform mole treated at one of nine Brazilian reference centers from January 1990 to May 2016. At 6months from uterine evacuation, 96 (0.8%) patients had hCG levels raised but falling. In 15/96 (15.6%) patients, chemotherapy was initiated immediately per FIGO 2000 criteria, while 81/96 (84.4%) patients were managed expectantly. Among the latter, 65/81 (80.2%) achieved spontaneous remission and 16 (19.8%) developed postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Patients who received chemotherapy following expectant management required more time for remission (11 versus 8months; p=0.001), had a greater interval between uterine evacuation and initiating chemotherapy (8 versus 6months; p<0.001), and presented with a median WHO/FIGO risk score higher than women treated according to FIGO 2000 criteria (4 versus 2, p=0.04), but there were no significant differences in the need for multiagent treatment regimens (1/15 versus 3/16 patients, p=0.60). None of the women relapsed, and no deaths occurred in either group.","In order to avoid unnecessary exposure of women to chemotherapy, we no longer follow the FIGO 2000 recommendation to treat all patients with molar pregnancy and hCG raised but falling at 6months after evacuation.

Two weeks later, sclerosis was performed with sodium hydroxide/ethanol solutions and hydrogen peroxide. Sequential 15- or 30-minute exposures to 0.1 N solutions of sodium hydroxide in ethanol followed by 3% peroxide failed to completely eliminate the pig gallbladder epithelium in vivo; 0.5 N and 1.0 N sodium hydroxide in ethanol caused gross gallbladder hemorrhage, mural dissection, and one perforation.

Are there any effects of Sevoflurane and Desflurane anaesthesia on blood glucose levels in acute hyperglycemic diabetic rats?,"In this study, 30 male Wistar albino rats were included. Diabetes was induced by a single IP injection of streptozotocin. After the effects of chronic diabetes encountered, diabetic rats were randomly assigned into diabetic control (group DC), diabetic hyperglycemia group (group DH), diabetic hyperglycemia group with desflurane (group DH-D), and diabetic hyperglycemia group with sevoflurane (group DH-S) groups. The normoglycemic groups received an IP injection of the same amount of saline. Hyperglycemic diabetic rats were anaesthetized by desflurane 6 % or sevoflurane 2 % at a dose, by which minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) for rats would be one. The drugs were given for 4 hours within 100 % oxygen at a rate of 6 L.min-1. One hour after cessation of inhalation anesthesia, blood glucose levels were determined at 1st, 4th and 24th hours. 24 hours after the anaesthesia.

Blood glucose levels in the diabetic groups were similar at the end of 6 weeks period, after hyperglycemia and anaesthesia induction.","We found out that sevoflurane and desflurane administrations in hyperglycemic rats were both related with insignificant blood glucose level increase at early post anaesthesia period and at post anaesthesia 24th hours. We still think that patients undergoing anaesthesia protocols with acute hyperglycemia need relatively longer follow up periods (Tab. 1, Ref. 28).",closed_qa
Does tamoxifen ameliorate renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis by modulation of estrogen receptor α-mediated transforming growth factor-β1/Smad signaling pathway?,"After insult to the kidney, a renal fibrotic process is initiated with sustained inflammation, fibroblast activation and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Tamoxifen has been used as an anti-estrogen for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of tamoxifen on unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and its molecular mechanism. Renal fibrosis was induced by UUO in 7-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Tamoxifen (50 mg/kg) was given by oral gavage for 5 days before induction of renal fibrosis. Tamoxifen treatment was continued for 14 days after UUO operation. Histologic changes were examined by periodic acid-Schiff stain and Masson's trichrome stain. Expression of α-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, type I collagen, fibronectin and cell adhesion molecules were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. We also evaluated the effect of tamoxifen on estrogen receptor (ER)-α-mediated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad signaling pathway in vitro. Renal tubular injury and fibrosis were increased after UUO. Tamoxifen treatment significantly decreased UUO-induced renal tubular injury and fibrosis. Renal fibroblast activation, ECM deposition and inflammation were significantly increased after ureteral ligation. However, tamoxifen treatment significantly decreased UUO-induced renal fibroblast activation, ECM deposition and inflammation by suppression of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in vivo. Tamoxifen decreased TGF-β1-induced fibroblast proliferation and cell migration by modulating ERα-mediated TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in vitro.",These findings indicate that tamoxifen has a beneficial effect on UUO-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis by suppression of renal fibroblast activation via modulation of ERα-mediated renal TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.,closed_qa
"Are multiple Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains associated with disease outbreaks in Sudan , 2008-2009?","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) activity has recently been detected in the Kordufan region of Sudan. Since 2008, several sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks associated with high case-fatality have been reported in villages and rural hospitals in the region. In the present study, we describe a cluster of cases occurring in June 2009 in Dunkop village, Abyei District, South Kordufan, Sudan. Seven CCHF cases were involved in the outbreak; however, clinical specimens could be collected from only two patients, both of whom were confirmed as acute CCHF cases using CCHF-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S, M, and L segment sequences places the Abyei strain of CCHF virus in Group III, a virus group containing strains from various countries across Africa, including Sudan, South Africa, Mauritania, and Nigeria. The Abyei strain detected in 2009 is genetically distinct from the recently described 2008 Sudanese CCHF virus strains (Al-fulah 3 and 4), and the Abyei strain S and L segments closely match those of CCHF virus strain ArD39554 from Mauritania.",The present investigation illustrates that multiple CCHF virus lineages are circulating in the Kordufan region of Sudan and are associated with recent outbreaks of the disease occurring during 2008-2009.,closed_qa
Comparing self-reported optometric dry eye clinical practices in Australia and the United Kingdom: is there scope for practice improvement?,"The aim of this study was to compare the self-reported clinical practice behaviours of optometrists in Australia and the United Kingdom (UK) with respect to the diagnosis and management of dry eye disease (DED). We also sought to examine whether the reported practices of clinicians in each region were consistent with current evidence-based recommendations for DED. An online survey was distributed to optometrists (Australia, n = 654; UK, n = 1006). Respondents provided information about practice modality, years of optometric experience, preferred diagnostic and management strategies (stratified by DED severity) and the information/evidence base used to guide patient care. A total of 317 completed surveys were received (response rates, Australia: 21%, UK: 17%). Optometrists in both regions demonstrated similarly strong knowledge of tear film assessment and adopted both subjective and objective techniques to diagnose DED. Patient symptoms were considered the most important, valuable and commonly performed assessment by both Australian and UK respondents. UK practitioners valued and utilised conjunctival signs and tear meniscus height assessments more than Australian optometrists (p<0.05), who placed relatively greater emphasis on sodium fluorescein tear break-up time to diagnose DED (p<0.05). Clinicians in both locations tailored DED therapy to severity. While practitioners in both regions predominantly managed mild DED with eyelid hygiene and tear supplementation, Australian optometrists indicated prescribing topical corticosteroid therapy significantly more often than UK practitioners for moderate (14% vs 6%) and severe (52% vs 8%) disease (p<0.05). The major source of information used to guide practitioners' dry eye management practices was continuing education conferences.","This study highlights a range of parallels and divergences in dry eye clinical practice between Australian and UK optometrists. Our data identify both areas of strength in the adoption of evidence-based practice, as well as some potential to improve international translation of dry eye research evidence into practice.",closed_qa
Are tissue factor and urokinase-type plasminogen activator system related to the presence of cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients?,"The disturbances of haemostasis and enhanced oxidative stress (SOX) appear to contribute to the cardiovascular disease (CVD) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the disorders of coagulation/fibrinolysis system are associated with the presence of CVD in these patients. We compared pre-dialysis levels of uPA, suPAR, tissue factor (TF) and its inhibitor (TFPI), prothrombin fragment F1+2 (F1+2); a marker of SOX-Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) and a surrogate of inflammation-high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs CRP) in HD patients with and without CVD. The uPA/suPAR system and hs CRP values were significantly greater in patients with CVD than in those without CVD; whereas TF, TFPI, F1+2 and Cu/Zn SOD levels were comparable in both patient groups. TF was positively correlated with both uPA (p<0.001) and suPAR levels (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated levels of suPAR, TF and uPA were independently associated with the presence of CVD in HD patients.",The association between TF and uPA/suPAR system is significantly related to the presence of CVD in HD patients.,closed_qa
"Are patient expectations of bariatric surgery gender specific -- a prospective , multicenter cohort study?","The effect of bariatric surgery on weight loss and improvement of co-morbidities is no longer doubted. However, little attention has been given to the treatment goals from the patient's point of view (patient expectations). The objective of this study was to examine patients' expectations of bariatric surgery and identify gender differences. Bariatric patients were asked to complete a questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Overall, 248 patients participated in this study (69.4% females). The male patients (45.2 yr, SD±11.1) were significantly older than the female (41.8 yr, SD±12.0; P = .04) and suffered significantly more often from diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and sleep apnea. One hundred thirty patients (52.4%) expected to lose at least 45 kg and 39 patients (15.7%)>70 kg. The mean expected excess weight loss was 71.8%. Females expected significantly more often that surgery alone would induce weight loss (P = .03). ""Improved co-morbidity"" was by far the highest ranked parameter.","The male bariatric surgery patients were older and suffered from more co-morbidities. Most of the patients had unrealistic weight loss goals and overestimated the effect of the surgical intervention. However, for both female and male patients, ""improved co-morbidity"" was the most important issue.",closed_qa
Does 18FDG PET-CT imaging detect arterial inflammation and early atherosclerosis in HIV-infected adults with cardiovascular disease risk factors?,"Persistent vascular inflammation has been implicated as an important cause for a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in HIV-infected adults. In several populations at high risk for CVD, vascular 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) uptake quantified using 3D-positron emission-computed tomography (PET-CT) has been used as a molecular level biomarker for the presence of metabolically active proinflammatory macrophages in rupture-prone early atherosclerotic plaques. We hypothesized that 18FDG PET-CT imaging would detect arterial inflammation and early atherosclerosis in HIV-infected adults with modest CVD risk. We studied 9 HIV-infected participants with fully suppressed HIV viremia on antiretroviral therapy (8 men, median age 52 yrs, median BMI 29 kg/m2, median CD4 count 655 cells/μL, 33% current smokers) and 5 HIV-negative participants (4 men, median age 44 yrs, median BMI 25 kg/m2, no current smokers). Mean Framingham Risk Scores were higher for HIV-infected persons (9% vs. 2%, p < 0.01). 18FDG (370 MBq) was administered intravenously. 3D-PET-CT images were obtained 3.5 hrs later. 18FDG uptake into both carotid arteries and the aorta was compared between the two groups. Right and left carotid 18FDG uptake was greater (P < 0.03) in the HIV group (1.77 ±0.26, 1.33 ±0.09 target to background ratio (TBR)) than the control group (1.05 ± 0.10, 1.03 ± 0.05 TBR). 18FDG uptake in the aorta was greater in HIV (1.50 ±0.16 TBR) vs control group (1.24 ± 0.05 TBR), but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.18).","Carotid artery 18FDG PET-CT imaging detected differences in vascular inflammation and early atherosclerosis between HIV-infected adults with CVD risk factors and healthy HIV-seronegative controls. These findings confirm the utility of this molecular level imaging approach for detecting and quantifying glucose uptake into inflammatory macrophages present in metabolically active, rupture-prone atherosclerotic plaques in HIV infected adults; a population with increased CVD risk.",closed_qa
Does intracardiac QT integral on far-field ICD electrogram predict sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in ICD patients?,"Prediction of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) could help to guide preventive interventions in at-risk patients. The QRST integral (∫QT) reflects intrinsic repolarization properties. The objective of this study was to determine whether intracardiac ∫QT predicts VT/VF in the next few months in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Far-field (FF) and near-field (NF) right ventricular intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) were recorded via telemetry in 46 patients with structural heart disease and ICDs implanted for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Epochs of 4.9 ± 0.4 minutes during sinus rhythm (mean heart rate 70.9 ± 15.2 beats/min) and ventricular pacing at 105 beats/min were analyzed. Mean ∫QT was calculated on FF and NF EGMs as the algebraic sum of areas under the QRST curve and adjusted by mean heart rate. Patients were followed up for at least 3 months. True VT/VF events treated by the ICD served as the end point. During a mean follow-up of 4.6 months, 22 patients (48%) were treated for VT/VF. Unadjusted and adjusted by heart rate, FF EGM ∫QT in sinus rhythm was a significant predictor of VT/VF (unadjusted ∫QT hazard ratio 1.007; 95% confidence interval 1.002 to 1.0013; P = .007; adjusted ∫QT hazard ratio 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.36; P = .002). The highest quartile of intracardiac ∫QT predicted VT/VF (log-rank test P = .042) and identified patients at risk with a specificity of 86% and positive predictive value of 73%.",Increased intracardiac FF EGM ∫QT predicts VT/VF in patients with structural heart disease and secondary prevention ICDs.,closed_qa
Can the increase of bone mineral density following bisphosphonates treatments be explained by biomechanical considerations?,"We hypothesized that bone mineral density increase following bisphosphonates treatments may be explained by the influence of the drug on the mechanical bone remodeling parameters. Patients treated with bisphosphonates continuously increase their bone mineral density. This increase is explained in the first 12-18 months following the treatment by the filling of the transient remodeling deficit. Recently, results of a clinical study of alendronate treatment over 7 years still show a continuous increase of bone mineral density. These results raised several questions regarding our understanding of bisphosphonates mode of action. Bone remodeling is influenced by different factors including mechanical forces. In the present study, we propose then to consider the effect of bisphosphonates also under biomechanical considerations. Identification of the model with the clinical data showed that daily treatment of 10 and 20 mg alendronate decreased the bone turnover rate by 2% and 11%, respectively, in comparison with the 5 mg alendronate treatment. Moreover, the alendronate treatments decreases the resorption threshold stimulus by 19% (25%, 28%) for the 5 mg (10 and 20 mg, respectively) compared to placebo.","The increase of bone mineral density following bisphosphonates treatment may then be explained by biomechanical considerations. Based on this description, bisphosphonates treatment may indeed change the susceptibility of bone to its biomechanical environment decreasing the mechanical threshold where bone should undergo resorption.",closed_qa
Do c-reactive-protein levels associated with infection predict short- and long-term outcome after supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage?,"The aim of the current study was to assess the occurrence of infection and its impact on the short- and long-term outcome of patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). 247 patients suffering from supratentorial ICH were extracted from our local stroke database. Complete data sets including long-term functional outcome measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and baseline computed tomography data could be obtained in 113. The charts of these patients were screened for the presence and cause of infection, and baseline and maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. We identified 52 patients (50.5%) with infection during their hospital stay. Patients with infection, had significantly larger hemorrhages (28.7 vs. 11.9 ml; p = 0.002), a poorer admission status (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS, score 14 vs. 6; p = 0.002) and more frequently intraventricular hemorrhage extension (46.2 vs. 23.5%; p = 0.016) than those without infection. In a multivariate logistic regression model, baseline NIHSS score (odds ratio, OR, 1.2, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.1-1.31, p < 0.001), age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.03-1.16, p = 0.002) and maximal CRP levels (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.12-2.64, p = 0.013) were independent predictors of poor long-term functional outcome (mRS >2).",Infections were frequent complications in our cohort of ICH patients and occurred significantly more often in patients with poor functional outcome. Maximal CRP levels were an independent predictor of poor outcome in a multivariate model.,closed_qa
Do Standard Surgical Guides Produce Accurate and Precise Femoral Bone Resections During Total Knee Arthroplasty?,"Accurate alignment and balanced flexion and extension gaps are critical elements in achieving a successful outcome following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The ability to make accurate and precise bone cuts is essential in the creation of balanced gaps. We sought to determine if one type of modern-day standard surgical instrument using an intramedullary rod and posterior referencing produces accurate and precise distal and posterior femoral bone resections. Seventy-five consecutive patients undergoing TKA were divided into three groups, with 25 patients in each group receiving one of three implant designs: 25 Stryker Triathlon® CR (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ), 25 Zimmer NexGen® Flex CR (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN), and 25 StelKast Proven Gen-FlexTM CR (StelKast, Pittsburgh, PA). Flexion-extension gap matching was determined using only the medial flexion and extension gaps. Accuracy was determined by comparing actual resection thickness to desired resection thickness. ""Optimal"" accuracy was considered to be within 1.0mm of desired, and ""near-optimal"" accuracy was considered to be within 2.0mm of the desired resection thickness. Precision was determined by the variability of resection thicknesses within each system. Data demonstrated a lack of accuracy and precision across all three tested systems, with each system resulting in certain unique tendencies. Only one out of 75 cases resulted in optimal resection accuracy with all three cuts (Zimmer). When lowering the threshold to include both optimal and near-optimal (within 2 mm of error) with all three cuts, only one third of Stryker and Zimmer cases and two thirds of StelKast cases achieved this threshold, representing 44% of cases (33/75).","Improvements in instrumentation to increase accuracy and precision may be warranted. Errors in fixation may be due to the instrumentation itself, and altering instrumentation to include less modularity, provide more stable fixation, and more reliably seal the implant on the femur may be of benefit.",closed_qa
Does previous endotracheal aspirate allow guiding the initial treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia?,"Any delay in adequate antibiotic treatment compromises the outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, the diagnosis and optimal treatment of VAP remain a challenge for intensivists. We assessed the potential impact of using results of routine weekly endotracheal aspirate (EA) cultures to guide initial antibiotic treatment for VAP. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. We studied 113 VAP episodes and evaluated the concordance between the latest EA and the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). We stratified patients into three groups: concordant EA-BAL (concordant group), discordant EA-BAL (discordant group) and EA not performed group. We then compared the adequacy of the antibiotic prescribed initially and outcomes between the three groups. Ninety assessable EA-BAL samples were evaluated. When guided by EA, the initial antibiotic regimen was adequate in 85% of situations, a proportion significantly superior (P < 0.05) to that resulting from application of the ATS guidelines (73%). When clinicians did not have a pre-VAP EA to guide their treatment (EA not performed group), only 61% of treatments were adequate. No significant difference was observed between the three groups for length of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, nonpulmonary nosocomial infections and mortality.",Once-a-week routine quantitative EA cultures may help to improve the adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy for VAP.,closed_qa
Do hydrogen sulfide-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia require activation of both Cav3.2 and TRPA1 channels in mice?,"Hydrogen sulfide, a gasotransmitter, facilitates somatic pain signals via activation of Ca(v)3.2 T-type calcium channels in rats. Given evidence for the activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) channels by H(2)S, we asked whether TRPA1 channels, in addition to Ca(v)3.2 channels, contribute to the H(2)S-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in mice. Mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were evaluated by the von Frey test in mice. Ca(v)3.2 or TRPA1 channels in the sensory neurons were silenced by repeated intrathecal administration of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in mice. Intraplantar administration of NaHS evoked hyperalgesia and allodynia in mice, an effect attenuated or abolished by NNC 55-0396 or mibefradil, T-type calcium channel blockers, and by ascorbic acid or zinc chloride, known to selectively inhibit Ca(v)3.2 channels, out of the three isoforms of T-type calcium channels. Silencing of Ca(v)3.2 channels in the sensory neurons also prevented the NaHS-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia in mice. The NaHS-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia in mice were significantly suppressed by AP18, a TRPA1 channel blocker, and by silencing of TRPA1 channels in the sensory neurons.",Mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by NaHS/H(2)S required activation of both Ca(v)3.2 and TRPA1 channels in mice.,closed_qa
Should all sexually active young women in Hungary be screened for Chlamydia trachomatis?,"Cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out to develop screening strategy for Chlamydia trachomatis to assess the possibility of preventing pelvic inflammatory disease and its sequelae. An 18 months epidemiological study of prevalence of chlamydial infection among pregnant women was carried out in Hungary. The policy of testing and treating was less cost-effective than neither testing nor treating, unless the cost of the diagnostic test were less than or equal to US$ 10, or the prevalence of infection in women were greater than 8.3.","Since the prevalence of chlamydial infection amongst 15-24 years old women in this study was 8.0%, the cost of screening in Hungary only barely outweighs the benefit in economic terms. Given the undesirable potential consequences of the infection, it is thus recommended that Hungarian clinicians should screen all young, sexually active women for C. trachomatis at the same time as they perform routine pelvic examinations.",closed_qa
Does inhibition of STAT-3 result in radiosensitization of human squamous cell carcinoma?,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) is a downstream component of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFr) signaling process that may facilitate the resistance of tumor cells to conventional cancer treatments. Studies were performed to determine if inhibition of this downstream protein produces radiosensitization. A431 cells (human squamous cell carcinoma cells with EGFr overexpression) were found to be sensitized to radiation after treatment with STAT-3 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Therefore, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against STAT-3 was designed and cloned into a pBABE vector system modified for shRNA expression. Following transfection, clone 2.1 was selected for further study as it showed a dramatic reduction of STAT-3 protein (and mRNA) when compared to A431 parental cells or a negative control shRNA cell line (transfected with STAT-3 shRNA with 2 base pairs mutated). A431 2.1 showed doubling times of 25-31h as compared to 18-24h for the parental cell line. The A431 shRNA knockdown STAT-3 cells A431 were more sensitive to radiation than A431 parental or negative STAT-3 control cells.",A431 cells stably transfected with shRNA against STAT-3 resulted in enhanced radiosensitivity. Further work will be necessary to determine whether the inhibition of STAT-3 phosphorylation is a necessary step for the radiosensitization that is induced by the inhibition of EGFr.,closed_qa
Do macrophages accumulate in the gut mucosa of untreated HIV-infected patients?,"Mucosal macrophages are involved in the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity and the elimination of invading pathogens. Although an intestinal barrier defect and microbial translocation are hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, recent data on gut mucosal macrophages in HIV infection are sparse. Treatment-naive and treated HIV-infected patients and healthy controls were studied for frequencies and functional parameters of blood monocytes and macrophages in duodenal mucosa. We found mucosal enrichment of macrophages in untreated HIV infection associated with reduced monocyte counts in blood and increased monocyte expression of the gut-homing molecule integrin β7. Increased CCR2 density on integrin β7-expressing monocytes and mucosal secretion of CCL2 suggest that CCR2/CCL2-chemotaxis is involved in enhanced trafficking of blood monocytes to the gut. Secretion of macrophage-related proinflammatory molecules interleukin 1β, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 was increased in the gut mucosa of untreated patients. Moreover, mucosal macrophages of untreated patients showed reduced phagocytic activity.","These data suggest a role for gut mucosal macrophages in HIV immune pathogenesis: infiltrated macrophages in the intestinal mucosa may promote local inflammation and tissue injury, whereas their low phagocytic activity prevents the efficient elimination of luminal antigens that cross the damaged intestinal barrier.",closed_qa
Does atractylodes macrocephala Koidz stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration through a polyamine dependent mechanism?,"Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (AMK), a valuable traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been widely used in clinical practice for treating patients with disorders of the digestive system. AMK has shown noteworthy promoting effect on improving gastrointestinal function and immunity, which might represent a promising candidate for the treatment of intestinal mucosa injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of AMK on intestinal mucosal restitution and the underlying mechanisms via intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cell migration model. A cell migration model of IEC-6 cells was induced by a single-edge razor blade along the diameter of the cell layers in six-well polystyrene plates. After wounding, the cells were grown in control cultures and in cultures containing spermidine (5μM, SPD, reference drug), alpha-difluoromethylornithine (2.5mM, DFMO, polyamine inhibitor), AMK (50, 100, and 200mg/L), DFMO plus SPD and DFMO plus AMK for 12h. The polyamines content was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with pre-column derivatization. The Rho mRNAs expression levels were assessed by Q-RT-PCR. The Rho and non-muscle myosin II proteins expression levels were analyzed by Western blot. The formation and distribution of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers were monitored with immunostaining techniques using specific antibodies and observed by confocal microscopy. Cell migration assay was carried out using inverted microscope and the Image-Pro Plus software. All of these indexes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of AMK. (1) Treatment with AMK caused significant increases in cellular polyamines content and Rho mRNAs and proteins expression levels, as compared to control group. Furthermore, AMK exposure increased non-muscle myosin II protein expression levels and formation of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers, and resulted in an acceleration of cell migration in IEC-6 cells. (2) Depletion of cellular polyamines by DFMO resulted in a decrease of cellular polyamines levels, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, thereby inhibiting IEC-6 cell migration. AMK not only reversed the inhibitory effects of DFMO on the polyamines content, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, but also restored cell migration to control levels.","The results obtained from this study revealed that AMK significantly stimulates the migration of IEC-6 cells through a polyamine dependent mechanism, which could accelerate the healing of intestinal injury. These findings suggest the potential value of AMK in curing intestinal diseases characterized by injury and ineffective repair of the intestinal mucosa in clinical practice.",closed_qa
Is high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T associated with coronary artery calcification?,"Recent studies have suggested that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) may be useful for detecting subclinical atherosclerosis and assessing cardiovascular disease risk. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum hs-cTnT is associated with the degree of coronary artery calcification. We measured serum hs-cTnT concentrations and performed multidetector row coronary CT in 215 consecutive, stable patients with clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease. Nonenhanced coronary CT was performed to determine the coronary calcium score, and contrast-enhanced coronary CT was performed to identify obstructive coronary artery disease. We then evaluated the relationship between serum hs-cTnT concentrations and the degree of coronary calcium or obstructive coronary artery disease using multiple regression analysis and logistic regression models. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that serum hs-cTnT concentrations and calcium score were independently associated after logarithmic transformation (β = 0.348; P < .0001). Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that serum hs-cTnT concentration was associated with an increased odds of an Agatston score >10 (odds ratio, 1.250; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.150-1.378), an Agatston Score >400 (odds ratio, 1.101; 95% CI, 1.054-1.157), and obstructive coronary artery disease (odds ratio, 1.119; 95% CI, 1.066-1.185).",Serum hs-cTnT is associated with coronary calcium in individuals with suspected coronary disease and may therefore be a marker to detect subclinical atherosclerosis.,closed_qa
A contraction response of the internal anal sphincter to Botulinum toxin: does low-pressure chronic anal fissure have a different pathophysiology?,"Twenty five units of botulinum toxin (Botox(TM)) were injected directly into the internal anal sphincter. Maximum resting pressure (MRP) and maximum squeeze increment (MSI) were documented at baseline and four weeks after injection. Nine (31%) of 29 patients had a low-pressure fissure. Those with an anterior fissure had a significantly lower median baseline MRP than those with a posterior fissure (66 vs 83 mmHg, P = 0.009). Significantly more patients with low-pressure fissures developed a contraction or no response (78%vs 30%, difference 48%, 95% CI 14-82%, P = 0.006). Those developing a contraction response had a lower mean baseline MRP than those developing a relaxation response (56 vs 86 mmHg, difference 30 mmHg, 95% CI 17-43%, P<0.001).",Botulinum toxin appears to have an atypical contraction effect on the internal anal sphincter in low-pressure (usually anterior) fissures. This may be accounted for by blockade of acetylcholine released at parasympathetic nerve terminals and the sympathetic ganglion (relaxation). Low pressure fissures may be physiologically different from high-pressure fissures.,closed_qa
Do antibodies against PM/Scl-75 and PM/Scl-100 are independent markers for different subsets of systemic sclerosis patients?,"Anti-PM/Scl antibodies are present in sera from patients with polymyositis (PM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and PM/SSc overlap syndromes. The prevalence of antibodies against the 75- and 100-kDa PM/Scl proteins and their clinical associations have not been studied in SSc patients in detail so far but could provide a valuable tool for risk assessment in these patients. Furthermore, it remains speculative whether commercially available test systems detecting only anti-PM/Scl-100 antibodies are sufficient in SSc patients. Two hundred eighty sera from SSc patients, patients with other connective tissue diseases (n = 209), and healthy blood donors (n = 50) were analyzed for the presence of anti-PM/Scl-75 and anti-PM/Scl-100 antibodies by means of line immunoblot assay. For the SSc patients, possible associations between both subsets of anti-PM/Scl antibodies with clinical and laboratory findings were studied. The determination of anti-PM/Scl reactivity revealed a diagnostic sensitivity of 12.5% and a specificity of 96.9% for SSc. Among anti-PM/Scl-positive SSc patients, 10.4% and 7.1% were positive for anti-PM/Scl-75 and anti-PM/Scl-100 antibodies, respectively. The highest prevalences of reactivity to PM/Scl were detected in diffuse SSc (19.8%) and overlap syndromes (17.6%). Patients with diffuse SSc showed mainly an anti-PM/Scl-75 response, whereas most cases of overlap syndromes were characterized by reactivity to both PM/Scl antigens. The presence of anti-PM/Scl-75/100 antibodies was associated with muscular and lung involvements as well as with digital ulcers; pulmonary arterial hypertension was found less frequently. Anti-PM/Scl-75 antibodies were detected more frequently in younger and more active patients with joint contractures. Anti-PM/Scl-100 antibodies were associated with creatine kinase elevation; however, gastrointestinal involvements were observed less frequently.","Anti-PM/Scl antibodies are common in distinct SSc subsets and are associated with several clinical symptoms. They are directed mainly to the PM/Scl-75 antigen. Consequently, the detection of anti-PM/Scl antibodies by tests based only on PM/Scl-100 as an antigen source may miss a relevant number of SSc patients positive for these antibodies.",closed_qa
Do incentives improve outcome in outpatient behavioral treatment of cocaine dependence?,"To assess whether incentives improved treatment outcome in ambulatory cocaine-dependent patients. Forty cocaine-dependent adults were randomly assigned to behavioral treatment with or without an added incentive program. The behavioral treatment was based on the Community Reinforcement Approach and was provided to both groups. Subjects in the group with incentives received vouchers exchangeable for retail items contingent on submitting cocaine-free urine specimens during weeks 1 through 12 of treatment, while the group without incentives received no vouchers during that period. The two groups were treated the same during weeks 13 through 24. Seventy-five percent of patients in the group with vouchers completed 24 weeks of treatment vs 40% in the group without vouchers (P = .03). Average durations of continuous cocaine abstinence documented via urinalysis during weeks 1 through 24 of treatment were 11.7 +/- 2.0 weeks in the group with vouchers vs 6.0 +/- 1.5 weeks in the group without vouchers (P = .03). At 24 weeks after treatment entry, the voucher group evidenced significantly greater improvement than the no-voucher group on the Drug scale of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and only the voucher group showed significant improvement on the ASI Psychiatric scale.",Incentives delivered contingent on submitting cocaine-free urine specimens significantly improve treatment outcome in ambulatory cocaine-dependent patients.,closed_qa
Does estradiol regulate expression of polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule by human vascular endothelial cells?,"The mechanism of atherogenesis includes leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells followed by migration into the subendothelial space. The polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecules (PSA-nCAMs) are a group of hydrophilic neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) isoforms that inhibit NCAM: NCAM association, thereby blocking cell: cell adhesion. During previous studies, we demonstrated that sialylation of specific NCAMs are upregulated at proestrus in the rat and that PSA-nCAM is expressed by the rat vascular endothelium. In this study, we sought the presence of PSA-nCAM in human vessels and regulation of its expression in estradiol-treated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC). Immunoreactive PSA-nCAM (ir-PSA-nCAM) was shown in blood and lymph vessels of adult rats and human brain, skin, liver, lung, cervix, endometrium, and ovary. Staining for ir-PSA-nCAM was present on the glycocalyceal surface of estradiol-treated HUVEC, but not in the presence of the estrogen receptor (ER)-blocker fulvestrant. Western blotting confirmed these findings.","PSA-nCAM is widely present in the glycocalyx of human and rat vascular endothelium. It also is expressed by HUVEC, in which it is induced by estradiol. The estrogen-regulated presence of vascular PSA-nCAM could diminish NCAM-dependent interactions between vessels and circulating leukocytes, thereby impeding vascular inflammation and atherogenesis, and, contributing to estrogen-induced cardioprotection. This hypothesized action is presently under study.",closed_qa
Crohn's disease and smoking: is it ever too late to quit?,"Smoking increases CD risk. The aim was to determine if smoking cessation at, prior to, or following, CD diagnosis affects medication use, disease phenotypic progression and/or surgery. Data on CD patients with disease for ≥5 yrs were collected retrospectively including the Montreal classification, smoking history, CD-related abdominal surgeries, family history, medication use and disease behaviour at diagnosis and the time when the disease behaviour changed. 1115 patients were included across six sites (mean follow-up-16.6 yrs). More non-smokers were male (p=0.047) with A1 (p<0.0001), L4 (p=0.028) and perianal (p=0.03) disease. Non-smokers more frequently received anti-TNF agents (p=0.049).

Does bufalin inhibit gefitinib resistant NCI-H460 human lung cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro?,"Bufalin, a component of Chan Su (frog), has been shown to have biological activities including anti-tumor effects. Gefitinib has been used as an anti-cancer drug in lung cancer patients; however, some patients eventually become gefitinib resistant. In this study, we investigated anti-metastasis effects of bufalin in gefitinib resistant NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. The effects of the bufalin in gefitinib resistant NCI-H460 lung cancer cells were investigated on cell viability using flow cytometry. The adhesion capacity, wound healing assay, invasion and migration assay, and Western blot analysis were used to understand the molecular mechanisms in this study RESULTS: Under sub-lethal concentrations (from 2.5 up to 10nM), bufalin significantly inhibits cell adhension, migration and invasion nature of gefitinib resistant H460 cells. Western blotting assay revealed that bufalin depressed some of the key metastasis-related proteins, such as SOS-1, MMP-2 and Rho A underwent significant reduction. Phosphorylated Focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2), Ras and E-cadherin were significantly reduced at 48h treatment. However, phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (p-JNK1/2) and NF-κBp65 were increased.","Based on these observations, we suggest that bufalin can be used in anti-metastasis of gefitinib resistant NCI-H460 lung cancer cells in the future.",closed_qa
Does single sevoflurane exposure decrease neuronal nitric oxide synthase levels in the hippocampus of developing rats?,"The use of general anaesthetics in young children and infants has raised concerns regarding the adverse effects of these drugs on brain development. Sevoflurane might have harmful effects on the developing brain; however, these effects have not been well investigated. Postnatal day 7 (P7) Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously exposed to 2.3% sevoflurane for 6 h. We used the Fox battery test and Morris water maze (MWM) to examine subsequent neurobehavioural performance. Cleaved caspase-3 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were quantified by immunoblotting, and the Nissl staining was used to observe the histopathological changes in the hippocampus. A single 6 h sevoflurane exposure at P7 rats resulted in increased cleaved caspase-3 expression and decreased nNOS levels in the hippocampus, and induced the loss of pyramidal neurones in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus at P7-8. These changes were accompanied by temporal retardation of sensorimotor reflexes. However, neither the Fox battery test at P1-21 nor the MWM test at P28-32 showed differences between the air- and sevoflurane-treated groups.","Although early exposure to sevoflurane increases activated caspase-3 expression and neuronal loss and decreases nNOS in the neonatal hippocampus, it does not affect subsequent neurobehavioural performances in juvenile rats.",closed_qa
Is increased expression of αTubulin associated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer after surgical resection?,"αTubulin, the essential orchestrator of cytoskeletal protein polymers, critical for cell growth and division, motility, signaling development and maintenance of cell shape, plays vital roles in the oncogenesis and progression of various types of cancer, but its role in prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate its prognostic value in patients with pancreatic cancer after surgical resection. αTubulin expression in pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with N classification (p = 0.013) and TNM stage (p = 0.025). Increased expression of αTubulin in tumoral tissue was associated with decreased overall survival rate (p = 0.002). Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that αTubulin expression was an independent prognostic indicator for pancreatic cancer except for T and N classification (p = 0.002). Using multivariate analysis, αTubulin expression, CA19-9, and N classification were selected to generate the nomogram to predict the 1-year and 3-year overall survival. The c-index of this model was 0.692. The calibration curve for probability of survival showed good agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. αTubulin expression was evaluated by tissue microarrays from 124 pancreatic cancer patients and statistically assessed for correlations with the clinical profiles and the prognosis of the patients with pancreatic cancer. The prognostic nomogram was designed to predict 1-year and 3-year overall survival probability.",αTubulin expression might be an independent prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer after surgical resection and could potentially be a high-priority therapeutic target. Incorporating αTubulin expression into CA19-9 and N classification can provide a good prognostic model.,closed_qa
Do recruitment maneuvers modulate epithelial and endothelial cell response according to acute lung injury etiology?,"To investigate the effects of the rate of increase in airway pressure and duration of lung recruitment maneuvers in experimental pulmonary and extrapulmonary acute lung injury. Prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study. University research laboratory. Fifty adult male Wistar rats. Acute lung injury was induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide either intratracheally (pulmonary acute lung injury) or intraperitoneally (extrapulmonary acute lung injury). After 24 hours, animals were assigned to one of three different recruitment maneuvers, targeted to maximal airway pressure of 30 cm H2O: 1) continuous positive airway pressure for 30 seconds (CPAP-30); 2) stepwise airway pressure increase (5 cm H2O/step, 8.5 s at each step) over 51 seconds (STEP-51) to achieve a pressure-time product similar to that of CPAP-30; and 3) stepwise airway pressure increase (5 cm H2O/step, 5 s at each step) over 30 seconds with maximum pressure sustained for a further 30 seconds (STEP-30/30). All recruitment maneuvers reduced static lung elastance independent of acute lung injury etiology. In pulmonary acute lung injury, CPAP-30 yielded lower surfactant protein-B and higher type III procollagen expressions compared with STEP-30/30. In extrapulmonary acute lung injury, CPAP-30 and STEP-30/30 increased vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, but the type of recruitment maneuver did not influence messenger ribonucleic acid expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products, surfactant protein-B, type III procollagen, and pro-caspase 3.","CPAP-30 worsened markers of potential epithelial cell damage in pulmonary acute lung injury, whereas both CPAP-30 and STEP-30/30 yielded endothelial injury in extrapulmonary acute lung injury. In both acute lung injury groups, recruitment maneuvers improved respiratory mechanics, but stepwise recruitment maneuver without sustained airway pressure appeared to associate with less biological impact on lungs.",closed_qa
Was molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH) present in archaeological case series?,"With respect to the unknown aetiology of molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH), it is unclear whether this phenomenon was overlooked in the last century as a result of a high number of caries in children or if this developmental disorder was not present until then. Therefore, this study determined the presence of MIH in historical dentitions and teeth. Dental remains from late medieval (n = 191, twelfth-sixteenth century, Regensburg, Germany), post-medieval (n = 33, sixteenth-eighteenth century, Passau, Germany) and modern age archaeological skeletal series (n = 99, nineteenth-twentieth century, Altdorf, Germany) were examined for MIH. In addition, linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), diffuse opacities, hypoplasia and Turner's teeth were documented. MIH-related demarcated opacities or enamel breakdowns were found in only 15 (0.4 %) of the 3891 examined permanent teeth. Ten cases (3.1 %) from a total of 323 dentitions were classified as having MIH. In contrast, 98 individuals (30.3 %) showed LEH. Other enamel disorders were recorded in 64 individuals (19.8 %).","With respect to the low number of affected dentitions and teeth, MIH most likely did not exist or was at least rarely present in the investigated archaeological case series.",closed_qa
Is admission hyperglycemia predictive of outcome in critically ill trauma patients?,"There is a paucity of data evaluating whether hyperglycemia at admission is associated with adverse outcome in trauma patients. Our objectives were to determine whether admission hyperglycemia was predictive of outcome in critically ill trauma patients. Prospective data were collected daily on 1,003 consecutive trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit over a 2-year period. Diabetics were excluded. Patients were stratified by admission serum glucose level (<200 mg/dL vs. > or =200 mg/dL) age, gender, Injury Severity Score, and other preexisting risk factors. Outcome was measured by incidence of infection, ventilator days, hospital length of stay and intensive care unit length of stay, and mortality. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine level of significance. Two hundred fifty-five of 1,003 (25%) patients were admitted with hyperglycemia over the study period. The majority (78%) of the admissions were caused by blunt injury. Male patients accounted for the majority of the study population (73%); however, female patients were more likely to be hyperglycemic at admission (p = 0.015). Patients with hyperglycemia had an overall greater infection rate and hospital length of stay. The hyperglycemic group had a 2.2-times greater risk of mortality when adjusted for age and Injury Severity Score.",Hyperglycemia at admission is an independent predictor of outcome and infection in trauma patients. Future investigation on the effects of hyperglycemia are warranted.,closed_qa
Does intravascular sonotherapy decrease neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation in swine?,"Intimal hyperplasia and subsequent in-stent restenosis remain a major limitation after stent implantation. In vitro cell culture studies show that low-frequency, noncavitational ultrasound energy may impact smooth muscle cell proliferation. Accordingly, we assessed the efficacy of intravascular sonotherapy treatment on intimal hyperplasia in a swine stent model. After balloon injury, biliary stents (Johnson & Johnson) were implanted in the femoral arteries of 14 swine. A total of 48 stented sites were randomized to sonotherapy or sham treatment using a custom-built, 8-French catheter intravascular sonotherapy system (URX, PharmaSonics Inc). After stent deployment, ultrasound energy (700 KHz) was applied to the treatment group for up to 5 minutes. Smooth muscle cell proliferation was assessed using bromodeoxyuridine histology preparation (BrdU) at 7 days in 28 stented sites. At 28 days, the neointimal thickness and the ratio of neointimal/stent area (percent stenosis) was calculated by histomorphometric quantification in 20 stented sites. At 7 days, percent of BrdU staining was significantly reduced in the sonotherapy group compared with the sham group (24.1+/-7.0% versus 31.2+/-3.0%, P<0.05). At 28 days, percent stenosis was significantly less in the sonotherapy group than in the sham group (36+/-24% versus 44+/-27%, P<0.05), and the mean neointimal thickness in the sonotherapy group was less than in the sham group (417+/-461 micrometer versus 643+/-869 micrometer, P=0.06).","In this swine peripheral model, intravascular sonotherapy seemed to decelerate cellular proliferation and decrease in-stent hyperplasia. Therefore, intravascular sonotherapy may be an effective form of nonionizing energy to reduce in-stent restenosis.",closed_qa
Are subepicardial action potential characteristics a function of depth and activation sequence in isolated rabbit hearts?,"Electric excitability in the ventricular wall is influenced by cellular electrophysiology and passive electric properties of the myocardium. Action potential (AP) rise time, an indicator of myocardial excitability, is influenced by conduction pattern and distance from the epicardial surface. This study examined AP rise times and conduction velocity as the depolarizing wavefront approaches the epicardial surface. Two-photon excitation of di-4-aminonaphthenyl-pyridinum-propylsulfonate was used to measure electric activity at discrete epicardial layers of isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts to a depth of 500 μm. Endo-to-epicardial wavefronts were studied during right atrial or ventricular endocardial pacing. Similar measurements were made with epi-to-endocardial, transverse, and longitudinal pacing protocols. Results were compared with data from a bidomain model of 3-dimensional (3D) electric propagation within ventricular myocardium. During right atrial and endocardial pacing, AP rise time (10%-90% of upstroke) decreased by ≈50% between 500 and 50 μm from the epicardial surface, whereas conduction velocity increased and AP duration was only slightly shorter (≈4%). These differences were not observed with other conduction patterns. The depth-dependent changes in rise time were larger at higher pacing rates. Modeling data qualitatively reproduced the behavior seen experimentally and demonstrated a parallel reduction in peak I(Na) and electrotonic load as the wavefront approaches the epicardial surface.",Decreased electrotonic load at the epicardial surface results in more rapid AP upstrokes and higher conduction velocities compared with the bulk myocardium. Combined effects of tissue depth and pacing rate on AP rise time reduce conduction safety and myocardial excitability within the ventricular wall.,closed_qa
Can attention control conditions have detrimental effects on behavioral medicine randomized trials?,"Attention control (AC) conditions are used to balance nonspecific attention in randomized trials of behavioral interventions. Very little guidance about which behavioral interventions and outcomes merit AC is available in the literature. The primary aim of the present study is to demonstrate a scenario in which use of AC in a behavioral randomized trial was unnecessary and possibly detrimental. Exploratory analyses were performed in a randomized controlled trial that tested whether a patient-centered counseling intervention reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in 355 participants with peripheral arterial disease, compared with AC and usual care (UC) conditions. The patient-centered counseling intervention was designed to activate participants to ask their physician for lipid-lowering medication and/or increase dose intensity, increase medication adherence, and reduce fat intake. The AC condition involved attention-matched telephone-delivered health education, and the UC condition consisted of an educational pamphlet. At 12-month follow-up, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol changes were -11.1 and -6.8 mg/dL in the UC and AC conditions, respectively (p=.17). The proportion of participants who increased the use or dose intensity of medication was significantly lower in AC than in UC: 17.5% versus 30.5% (p=.03). No significant difference in other outcomes was observed between AC and UC.","AC has significantly worse medication outcomes, and there is no indication of a therapeutic effect on other end points. Implications for the use of AC in behavioral randomized trials are discussed.",closed_qa
Is detection of asymptomatic recurrence during routine oncological followup after radical cystectomy associated with improved patient survival?,"Whether routine surveillance to detect tumor recurrence after radical cystectomy improves patient survival remains in debate. We determined the impact on all cause mortality of symptoms at recurrence after cystectomy. We identified 1,599 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma at our institution between 1980 and 2000. Median postoperative followup was 9.8 years (range 0 to 30.3). Overall survival in patients with recurrence stratified by the mode of diagnosis (asymptomatic vs symptomatic) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impact of the mode of diagnosing recurrence on survival. A total of 606 patients (38%) experienced recurrence after surgery, of whom 137 (23%) were asymptomatic and 469 (77%) were symptomatic. Recurrence sites included abdomen/pelvis in 450 patients, bone in 185, thorax in 176, urothelium in 154 and brain in 39. The most common symptoms at recurrence were pain in 75.3% of patients, constitutional symptoms in 57.4% and hematuria in 12.4%. Five and 10-year overall survival in patients with symptomatic vs asymptomatic recurrence was 22% and 10% vs 46% and 26%, respectively (p <0.0001). On multivariate analysis patients who were symptomatic at recurrence were at almost 60% increased risk for death than those who were asymptomatic (HR 1.59, p = 0.0001).","Detecting asymptomatic recurrence after cystectomy was associated with significantly improved patient survival. Continued investigation to establish the optimal followup regimen remains necessary, balancing the benefit of early detection with the increased cost of routine surveillance.",closed_qa
Is preoperative platelet to lymphocyte ratio a valuable prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer?,"Recent studies suggest that an elevated preoperative platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) may be considered a poor prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of PLR in patients with CRC. We enrolled 1314 patients who underwent surgery for CRC between 2005 and 2011. Preoperative PLR level was stratified into quintiles for Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models. Higher PLR quintiles were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that PLR was an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS) (P = 0.034). Patients in PLR quintile 5 had lower overall survival than in quintile 1 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.701, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.267-2.282, P < 0.001). Although patients in PLR quintile 5 had significantly lower disease-free survival (DFS) than in quintile 1 (HR = 1.522, 95% CI: 1.114-2.080, P = 0.008), this association was not significant after multivariable adjustment (P = 0.075). In the subgroup analysis, PLR remained an independent factor in terms of advanced tumor stage (III, IV), male sex, carcinoembryonic antigen (≤ 5 ng/ml), age (> 65 years) and body mass index (≤ 25) (P < 0.05 for all measurements). The results remained unchanged when the PLR was analyzed as a dichotomous variable by applying different cut-off values of 150, 185, 220.",Elevated preoperative PLR was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with CRC. The utility of PLR may help to improve prognostic predictors.,closed_qa
Are proliferating reactive astrocytes regulated by Notch-1 in the peri-infarct area after stroke?,"The formation of reactive astrocytes is common after central nervous system injuries such as stroke. However, the signaling pathway(s) that control astrocyte formation and functions are poorly defined. We assess the effects of Notch 1 signaling in peri-infarct-reactive astrocytes after stroke. We examined reactive astrocyte formation in the peri-infarct area 3 days after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion with or without γ-secretase inhibitor treatment. To directly study the effects of inhibiting a γ-secretase cleavage target in reactive astrocytes, we generated glial fibrillary acidic protein-CreER™:Notch 1 conditional knockout mice. Gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment after stroke decreased the number of proliferative glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive astrocytes and RC2-positive reactive astrocytes directly adjacent to the infarct core. The decrease in reactive astrocytes correlated with an increased number of CD45-positive cells that invaded into the peri-infarct area. To study the influence of reactive astrocytes on immune cell invasion, ex vivo immune cell invasion assays were performed. We found that a γ-secretase-mediated pathway in astrocytes affected Jurkat cell invasion. After tamoxifen treatment, glial fibrillary acidic protein-CreER™:Notch 1 conditional knockout mice had a significantly decreased number of proliferating reactive astrocytes and RC2-positive reactive astrocytes. Tamoxifen treatment also led to an increased number of CD45-positive cells that invaded the peri-infarct area.",Our results demonstrate that proliferating and RC2-positive reactive astrocytes are regulated by Notch 1 signal transduction and control immune cell invasion after stroke.,closed_qa
Does expiration-Triggered Sinus Arrhythmia predict Outcome in Survivors of Acute Myocardial Infarction?,"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of cardiac vagal modulation, provides cardiac risk stratification information. RSA can be quantified from Holter recordings as the high-frequency component of heart rate variability or as the variability of RR intervals in individual respiratory cycles. However, as a risk predictor, RSA is neither exceptionally sensitive nor specific. This study aimed to improve RSA determination by quantifying the amount of sinus arrhythmia related to expiration (expiration-triggered sinus arrhythmia [ETA]) from short-term recordings of electrocardiogram and respiratory chest excursions, and investigated the predictive power of ETA in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. Survivors of acute myocardial infarction (N = 941) underwent 30-min recordings of electrocardiogram and respiratory chest excursions. ETA was quantified as the RR interval change associated with expiration by phase-rectified signal averaging. Primary outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression was used to investigate the association of ETA with mortality. ETA was a strong predictor of mortality, both in univariable and multivariable analysis. In a multivariable model including respiratory rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, and GRACE score, ETA ≤0.19 ms was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 5.89, p < 0.0001). In patient subgroups defined by abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, increased respiratory rate, high GRACE score, or presence of diabetes mellitus, patients were classified as high or low risk on the basis of ETA.",Expiration-triggered sinus arrhythmia (ETA) is a potent and independent post-infarction risk marker.,closed_qa
Is low serum selenium concentration associated with preeclampsia in pregnant women from Bangladesh?,"Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy which is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality and pre-term delivery, especially in low and middle income countries. Selenium is an important constituent of selenoproteins that act as antioxidant and have several metabolic functions. The present study was conducted to determine serum selenium concentration in preeclampsia patients in order to find out the role of selenium in preeclampsia. This study was conducted as case-control study with 74 preeclampsia patients as cases whose gestation were ≥20 weeks (52 mild and 22 severe patients) and 118 normotensive pregnant women as controls from same gestational period. Detailed patient history was recorded during routine hospital visits. Serum selenium concentration was determined by using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Independent sample t-test and Pearson's correlation test were done for the statistical analysis using the statistical software package SPSS, version 16. Our study found that mean serum concentration of selenium in preeclampsia patients was significantly lower than that of healthy pregnant women (p<0.05). Further analysis for selenium concentration with disease severity explored that selenium concentration was significantly lower in severe preeclampsia in comparison to mild preeclampsia (p<0.05). We found no significant difference for selenium concentration between rural and urban preeclampsia patients (p>0.05). Pearson's correlation analysis reveals significant negative correlation of selenium with systolic blood pressure (r=-0.419, p=0.001), diastolic blood pressure (r=-0.392, p=0.001), and gestational period (r=-0.218, p=0.001).",Our study found that preeclampsia patients have decreased serum selenium concentration than the healthy pregnant women.,closed_qa
Does high-frequency electrical stimulation in the nucleus accumbens of morphine-treated rats suppress neuronal firing in reward-related brain regions?,"Previous studies have reported that high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a potential treatment modality for drug craving and relapse. We aimed to explore the electrophysiological changes in reward-related brain regions during NAc stimulation and reveal the effects of stimulation frequency and target changes on NAc neuronal activities. Twenty-eight rats were randomized into saline (n=8) and morphine (n=20) groups. The morphine group was further divided into core (n=10, only the core of the NAc was stimulated) and shell (n=10, only the shell of the NAc was stimulated) subgroups. Conditioned place preference (CPP) behavior of the rats was evaluated to confirm morphine preference after morphine injection and CPP training for 10 days. We recorded NAc neuronal responses to NAc core stimulation at different frequencies, as well as changes in VP and VTA neuronal firing during NAc core stimulation, and changes in NAc neuronal firing during NAc shell stimulation. The results indicate that high frequency stimulation was more effective in suppressing NAc neuronal activities than low frequency stimulation and that core stimulation was more effective than shell stimulation. Most VP neurons were inhibited by NAc core stimulation, while VTA neurons were not.",The results suggest that electrical stimulation in the NAc can suppress neuronal firing in reward-related brain regions. The stimulation might be frequency- dependent in suppressing neuronal firing. The core and shell of the NAc play different roles in suppressing NAc neuronal firing as 2 stimulating targets.,closed_qa
Does aberrant expression of N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase influence patient survival in malignant gliomas?,"To examine the expression of N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) gene and protein in glioma samples with different WHO grades and its association with patients' survival. Immunohistochemistry assay, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were carried out to investigate the expression of MPG gene and protein in 128 glioma and 10 non-neoplastic brain tissues. MPG gene expression level in glioma tissues was significantly higher than that in non-neoplastic brain tissues (P < 0.001). Immunohistochemistry also showed that MPG protein was over-expressed in glioma tissues, which was consistent with the resutls of Western blot analysis. Additionally, the expression levels of MPG gene and protein both increase from grade I to grade IV glioma according to the results of real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Moreover, the survival rate of MPG-positive patients was significantly lower than that of MPG-negative patients (P < 0.001). We further confirmed that the over-expression of MPG was a significant and independent prognostic indicator in glioma by multivariate analysis (P < 0.001).","Our data showed the over-expression of MPG gene and protein in human gliomas, and also suggested for the first time that MPG be an unfavorable independent prognostic indicator for glioma patients.",closed_qa
Do co-transplantation of endothelial progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells promote neovascularization and bone regeneration?,"Bone formation relies on sufficient blood supply and osteoprogenitor cells. The study aims to evaluate the influence of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in combination with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on early vascularization and intramembranous bone regeneration. Vertical bone regeneration was tested in rat calvarium guided bone regeneration model. Gold domes were filled with a mixture of 5 × 10(5) osteogenic transformed MSC and 5 × 10(5) EPC (EPC/MSC) that were mixed with β-tricalcium phosphate (βTCP) scaffold. Domes filled with βTCP alone served as control. Rats were sacrificed after 4 or 12 weeks. Histomorphometry was used to determine blood vessel (Bv) density, vertical bone height, and bone area in the regenerated tissue. At both time points, new augmented hard tissue filled the space under the dome, and Bv density was higher in the EPC/MSC transplanted group vs control. However, bone height and bone area were similar among the groups 4 weeks posttransplantation, but were doubled in the EPC/MSC transplanted group 12 weeks posttransplantation.",EPC/MSC transplantation increases Bv formation in the early stages of healing that precedes enhancement of extracortical bone regeneration in later stages.,closed_qa
Is previous cesarean section a risk for incidental cystotomy at the time of hysterectomy?,"The purpose of this study was to determine if previous cesarean section is an independent risk factor for incidental cystotomy at the time of hysterectomy. This is a case-controlled study that evaluated all cases of incidental cystotomy at the time of hysterectomy between January 1998 and December 2001. Five thousand and ninety-two hysterectomies were performed in the time period mentioned above, and 51 cases of incidental cystotomy were identified. Each case of incidental cystotomy was then matched to 3 controls with similar patient characteristics, medical histories, and surgical histories, as well as the absence of incidental cystotomy at the time of hysterectomy. Overall, 5092 hysterectomies were performed during the study period (total abdominal hysterectomy [TAH] 3140 [61.7%], total vaginal hysterectomy [TVH] 1519 [29.8%], laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy [LAVH] 433 [8.5%]). Fifty-one cases of incidental cystotomy were identified (TAH: 24 [47.1%], TVH: 19 [37.3%] 8 [15.7%]). The overall incidence of cystotomy was 1.0%. When considering TAH, there were 24/3141 (0.76%) cases of incidental cystotomy, with 8 (33%) of these patients with a history of previous cesarean section. During TVH, we encountered 19/1519 (1.3%) cases of incidental cystotomy, with 4 (21%) of these women having undergone a previous cesarean. Finally, during LAVH, there were 8/433 (1.8%) cases of incidental cystotomy. Five (62.5%) of these patients had a previous history of cesarean section. In comparison, 19/72 (26.4%) TAH controls had a previous history of cesarean. Four out of 57 (7.0%) TVH controls had a history of cesarean section.

Do photo-oxidation products of skin surface squalene mediate metabolic and inflammatory responses to solar UV in human keratinocytes?,"The study aimed to identify endogenous lipid mediators of metabolic and inflammatory responses of human keratinocytes to solar UV irradiation. Physiologically relevant doses of solar simulated UVA+UVB were applied to human skin surface lipids (SSL) or to primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). The decay of photo-sensitive lipid-soluble components, alpha-tocopherol, squalene (Sq), and cholesterol in SSL was analysed and products of squalene photo-oxidation (SqPx) were quantitatively isolated from irradiated SSL. When administered directly to NHEK, low-dose solar UVA+UVB induced time-dependent inflammatory and metabolic responses. To mimic UVA+UVB action, NHEK were exposed to intact or photo-oxidised SSL, Sq or SqPx, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), and the product of tryptophan photo-oxidation 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ). FICZ activated exclusively metabolic responses characteristic for UV, i.e. the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) machinery and downstream CYP1A1/CYP1B1 gene expression, while 4-HNE slightly stimulated inflammatory UV markers IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS genes. On contrast, SqPx induced the majority of metabolic and inflammatory responses characteristic for UVA+UVB, acting via AhR, EGFR, and G-protein-coupled arachidonic acid receptor (G2A).","Our findings indicate that Sq could be a primary sensor of solar UV irradiation in human SSL, and products of its photo-oxidation mediate/induce metabolic and inflammatory responses of keratinocytes to UVA+UVB, which could be relevant for skin inflammation in the sun-exposed oily skin.",closed_qa
Does intrauterine infusion of lidocaine reduce pain scores during IUD insertion?,"Potential pain with IUD insertion is a concern for women. Studies have found that systemic and local cervical therapies do not reduce pain scores. Since intrauterine infusion of lidocaine may reduce pain with endometrial aspiration, in this pilot study, we tested whether such infusion through an inexpensive endometrial aspirator could reduce IUD insertion pain scores with IUD insertion. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo control pilot study of 40 women undergoing IUD insertion, pain scores of women receiving 1.2 mL 2% lidocaine versus normal saline (1:1) infused 3 min prior to IUD insertion were measured using a 0-9-point scale. Pain at tenaculum placement was similar between groups. There was no difference in mean pain scores during IUD insertion of women infused with lidocaine (2.95) versus normal saline (3.75), p=.37. Considerable variation in pain scores was noted; 46% of subjects had pain scores ≤2 while 33% had pain scores ≥5.",Use of 2% lidocaine administered through an endometrial aspirator did not significantly reduce IUD insertion pain scores in this pilot study.,closed_qa
Does presence of coronary artery disease increase the risk of biliary events in patients with asymptomatic gallstones?,"Propensity score indicates a probability of having a confounding factor. It is used to match each patient with the closest propensity score between two groups, which is known as propensity score matching. This study aimed to evaluate the gallstone-related biliary events, defined as biliary colic and acute cholecystitis between coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-CAD patients using propensity score matching. This retrospective cohort study evaluated 267 asymptomatic gallstone patients with CAD and 459 asymptomatic gallstone patients without CAD from March 2003 to December 2009 at two tertiary teaching hospitals in the Republic of Korea. After propensity score matching, total 378 patients, including 126 in study group (with CAD) and 252 in control group (without CAD), were evaluated. During a median follow-up of 47 months, overall gallstone-related biliary event rate was 33.5% in the study group and 27.5% in the control group. The 5-year cumulative rates were 25.3% versus 17.7% in gallstone-related biliary event and 10.9% versus 1.6% in acute cholecystitis (study versus control group). After propensity score adjustment, the risk of gallstone-related biliary events in the CAD patients significantly increased (hazard ratio 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.14-3.90, P = 0.017 in matched patients).","In patients with asymptomatic gallstones, the coexistence of CAD can increase the risk of gallstone-related biliary events, particularly acute cholecystitis. Therefore, gallstone patients with CAD should be carefully monitored, even if they are asymptomatic.",closed_qa
Does neuronal calcium sensor-1 promote immature heart function and hypertrophy by enhancing Ca2+ signals?,"Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) regulates various neuronal functions. Although it is expressed in the heart, very little is known about its cardiac functions. This study aimed to identify the physiological and pathological roles of NCS-1 in the heart. We characterized the cardiac functions of knockout mice (Ncs1(-/-)) and identified NCS-1 as a novel regulator of cardiac Ca(2+) signaling, specifically in immature and hypertrophic hearts. NCS-1 was highly expressed in young hearts, and its deletion decreased survival and contractile function in young mice. Intracellular Ca(2+) levels and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content were significantly lower in Ncs1(-/-) myocytes than in wild-type cells. This was due to reduced Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity in Ncs1(-/-) myocytes, which led to reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) uptake and release. NCS-1 physically and functionally interacted with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) in the heart. In addition, IP(3)R stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of CaMKII-δ, which was enhanced by NCS-1 overexpression. These results suggest that a functional link exists between NCS-1, IP(3)R function, and CaMKII activation that may affect global Ca(2+) signals in the immature heart. Furthermore, NCS-1 was upregulated in hypertrophic hearts, and hormone-induced hypertrophy was largely prevented in Ncs1(-/-) hearts. Inhibitors of IP(3)Rs, CaMKII, and calcineurin all prevented NCS-1-induced hypertrophy, which suggests the involvement of these pathways.","NCS-1 is an important regulator of immature heart function and hypertrophy, and it functions in part by promoting IP(3)R function, followed by CaMKII-dependent signal activation.",closed_qa
Is anti-inflammatory activity of Chios mastic gum associated with inhibition of TNF-alpha induced oxidative stress?,"Gum of Chios mastic (Pistacia lentiscus var. chia) is a natural antimicrobial agent that has found extensive use in pharmaceutical products and as a nutritional supplement. The molecular mechanisms of its anti-inflammatory activity, however, are not clear. In this work, the potential role of antioxidant activity of Chios mastic gum has been evaluated. Scavenging of superoxide radical was investigated by electron spin resonance and spin trapping technique using EMPO spin trap in xanthine oxidase system. Superoxide production in endothelial and smooth muscle cells stimulated with TNF-α or angiotensin II and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or mastic gum (0.1-10 μg/ml) was measured by DHE and HPLC. Cellular H2O2 was measured by Amplex Red. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) with mastic gum was determined by the decrease of purified PKC activity, by inhibition of PKC activity in cellular homogenate and by attenuation of superoxide production in cells treated with PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Spin trapping study did not show significant scavenging of superoxide by mastic gum itself. However, mastic gum inhibited cellular production of superoxide and H2O2 in dose dependent manner in TNF-α treated rat aortic smooth muscle cells but did not affect unstimulated cells. TNF-α significantly increased the cellular superoxide production by NADPH oxidase, while mastic gum completely abolished this stimulation. Mastic gum inhibited the activity of purified PKC, decreased PKC activity in cell homogenate, and attenuated superoxide production in cells stimulated with PKC activator PMA and PKC-dependent angiotensin II in endothelial cells.",We suggest that mastic gum inhibits PKC which attenuates production of superoxide and H2O2 by NADPH oxidases. This antioxidant property may have direct implication to the anti-inflammatory activity of the Chios mastic gum.,closed_qa
Does adaptation to promiscuous usage of CC and CXC-chemokine coreceptors in vivo correlate with HIV-1 disease progression?,"To study coreceptor usage of sequential primary HIV-1 isolates in a longitudinal follow-up cohort of HIV-1-infected men to understand its contribution to pathogenesis of HIV disease. Viral coreceptor usage of sequential primary isolates from HIV-1-infected individuals was examined at various timepoints and data was compared with CD4 cell counts, rates of disease progression and beta-chemokine production. Fifty-eight sequential primary isolates were obtained from four rapid progressors, six late progressors, and three long-term nonprogressors (LTNP) and their coreceptor usage was examined by infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from donors with wild-type or non-functional CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)-5, and by infection of GHOST4 cells expressing CD4 and various chemokine receptors [CCR-1-CCR-5, CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)-4, BOB/GPR15, BONZO/STRL33]. Production of RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta was examined using unstimulated or phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBMC isolated from these individuals at multiple timepoints during infection. A switch from single CCR-5 coreceptor usage to multiple coreceptor usage occurred in all four rapid progressors and three out of six late progressors. In addition to the commonly used coreceptors CXCR-4, CCR-5, and CCR-3, some of the viruses isolated from patients in the terminal stage of infection also used CCR-1, CCR-2b, CCR-4, and BOB as coreceptors. The emergence of viral variants capable of utilizing multiple coreceptors generally preceded CD4 cell decline to < 200 x 10(6)/l and correlated with the onset of AIDS. In contrast, three LTNP maintained exclusive usage of CCR-5 over a period of 7-12 years post-infection. Endogenous production of RANTES and MIP-1beta by PBMC from LTNP was not significantly different from rapid and late progressors. However, PHA-driven production of both chemokines was significantly higher in LTNP, suggesting that in vivo activating stimuli might curtail HIV replication by inducing these chemokines.","Viral variants capable of utilizing a broad range of coreceptors correlated with HIV-1 disease progression. In contrast, LTNP maintain exclusive usage of CCR-5 and produce higher levels of beta-chemokines. Thus, both viral and host determinants leading to the emergence of viral variants capable of using an expanded range of coreceptors may be likely determinants of disease progression.",closed_qa
Is paraoxonase reduced in patients with growth hormone deficiency : A novel risk factor for atherosclerosis?,"Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality. Increased oxidative stress has been associated with development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate oxidant and antioxidant status in patients with GHD by analyzing serum paraoxonase1 (PON1) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and thiol levels. This study was a case-control study. Thirty patients with GHD were included in the study and compared with 20 healthy controls. Serum PON1 activity, and MDA and thiol levels were measured according to an enzymatic spectrophotometric method. Serum MDA levels (2.8 ± 1.3 nmol/mL) were higher in GHD group than the controls (1.7 ± 0.5 nmol/mL) (P = 0.001). PON1 activity (149.9 ± 77.9 U/L) was lower in GHD group than the controls (286.3 ± 126.7 U/L) (P = 0.001). Thiol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) levels were lower in GHD group (218.6 ± 103.9 µmol/L and 32.6 ± 13.4 mg/dL, respectively) than the controls (289.6 ± 101.1 µmol/L and 54.3 ± 14.9 mg/dL, respectively) (P = 0.021 and P = 0.001, respectively). In GHD patients, serum MDA level was negatively correlated with serum HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.499, P = 0.001), and serum PON1 activity was positively correlated with serum thiol and HDL-cholesterol levels (r = 0.306, P = 0.032 and r = 0.303, P = 0.033, respectively).",These data support that GHD is characterized by an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant factors. This abnormality may contribute to the increased atherogenic risk in patients with GHD.,closed_qa
Is african-american race a predictor of seminal vesicle invasion after radical prostatectomy?,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether racial differences exist in the pattern of local disease progression among men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer (PCa), which is currently unknown. In this study we evaluated the pattern of adverse pathologic features in an identical cohort of African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CS) men with PCa. The overall cohort consisted of 1104 men (224 AA, and 880 CS) who underwent RP between 1990 and 2012. We compared preoperative factors and pathologic outcomes after RP across race groups. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predictive of adverse pathologic outcomes. The effect of race on adverse pathologic outcomes and biochemical control rate (BCR) was evaluated using multivariate regression model and Kaplan-Meier analysis. The 10-year BCR was 59% versus 82% in AA and CS men, respectively (P = .003). There was no significant difference in extraprostatic spread (P = .14), positive surgical margin (P = .81), lymph node involvement (P = .71), or adverse pathologic features (P = .16) across race groups. However, among patients with ≥ 1 adverse pathologic features, AA men had higher rate of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) compared with CS men (51% vs. 30%; P = .01). After adjusting for known predictors of adverse pathologic features AA race remained a predictor of SVI.","AA men have an increased risk of SVI after RP, particularly among men with Gleason ≤ 6 disease. This might represent racial differences in the biology of PCa disease progression, which contribute to poorer outcomes in AA men.",closed_qa
Do microembolic signals predict cerebral ischaemic events in patients with moyamoya disease?,"Recent studies found that microembolic signals (MESs) could be detected by transcranial Doppler in patients with moyamoya disease. However, the clinical significance of MESs in moyamoya disease remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate whether the MESs could predict cerebral ischaemic events in patients with moyamoya disease. Fifty-four consecutive patients with moyamoya disease were recruited. MESs were monitored by transcranial Doppler for 30 min in the bilateral middle cerebral arteries of each patient on admission. Patients were followed up for 1 year. The primary end-point was cerebral ischaemic events including stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). MESs were detected in 11 (20.4%) patients, with a frequency of 11 (10.2%) in 108 hemispheres. Logistic regression analysis revealed that previous ischaemic events within 3 months were associated with the presence of MESs (odds ratio 4.41, 95% CI 1.11-17.59). During a median follow-up of 384 days, 14 (13.0%) hemispheres had ischaemic events (seven strokes and seven TIAs). Cox regression showed that the hazard ratio for the risk of new ischaemic stroke and TIA in the hemispheres with MESs was 6.84 (95% CI 1.82-25.66) compared with those without, and 10.61 (95% CI 1.66-67.70) for ischaemic stroke alone, after controlling for age, sex, presence of ischaemic events at baseline, Suzuki stages and revascularization surgery.","In patients with moyamoya disease, the presence of MESs is associated with recent ischaemic symptoms and independently predicts cerebral ischaemic events. MES detection may be of potential clinical value in the management of patients with moyamoya disease.",closed_qa
Does algorithm for quantitative 3 dimensional analysis of ECG signals improve myocardial diagnosis over cardiologists in diabetic patients?,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) diagnosis in type II diabetes (DM2) patients is difficult and ECG findings are often non-diagnostic or inconclusive. We developed computer algorithms to process standard 12-lead ECG input data for quantitative 3-dimensional (3D) analysis (my3KGTM), and hypothesized that use of the my3KGTM's array of over 100 3D-based AMI diagnostic markers may improve diagnostic accuracy for AMI in DM2 patients. We identified 155 consecutive DM2 patients age >25 yrs with chest discomfort or shortness of breath who were evaluated at an urban emergency department (130 patients (pts)) or the cardiac catheterization laboratory (25 pts) for possible AMI. The first digital 12-lead ECG for each patient, obtained within 30 min of presentation, was evaluated by (1) 2 blinded expert cardiologists, and (2) my3KGTM. In each case, the ECG was classified as either likely AMI or likely non-AMI. ""Gold standard"" was the final clinical diagnosis. Statistical analysis was McNemar's test with continuity correction. The 155 DM2 patients were 50% male, mean age 56.8 ± 12.0 yrs; 44 pts had a final clinical diagnosis of AMI (17 ST Elevation Myocardial Infarctions (STEMI), 27 Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarctions (NSTEMI)) and 111 had no AMI.","Relative to standard 12L ECG read by cardiologists, quantitative 3D ECG analysis showed significant and substantial gains in sensitivity for AMI diagnosis in DM2 patients, without loss in specificity. Sensitivity gains were particularly high in patients exhibiting NSTEMI, the most common form of AMI in DM2.",closed_qa
Is serum albumin predictive of 30-day survival after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy?,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes have been used since 1980 in patients who require prolonged enteral feeding. To identify factors associated with poor survival (defined as survival < 30 days) post-PEG. We assessed a cohort of 64 patients consecutively referred for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube in a single, tertiary care hospital. Prior to PEG tube placement, we evaluated relevant clinical variables in each patient to determine their effect on 30-day mortality. Of the cohort, 43 of 64 (67.2%) survived at least 30 days after tube placement. One death was attributable to tube placement. Bivariate analyses showed that 30-day survival correlated directly with serum albumin (r = .253; p = .049) and inversely with creatinine (r = -0.255; p = .042). Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, only albumin was identified as an independent predictor of 30-day survival (p = .044). Eighty-three percent of patients with a serum albumin > or = 3.0 g/dL survived 30 days compared with 58% with an albumin < 3.0, a difference of 25% (95% CI, -2% to 54%; p = .07).","In conclusion, serum albumin appears to be a predictor of early survival in individuals undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.",closed_qa
Alcohol increases circulatory disease mortality in Russia: acute and chronic effects or misattribution of cause?,"There is a consensus that the large fluctuations in mortality seen in Russia in the past two decades can be attributed to trends in alcohol consumption. However, the precise mechanisms linking alcohol to mortality from circulatory disease remain unclear. It has recently been argued that a substantial number of such deaths currently ascribed to cardiovascular disorders are misclassified cases of acute alcohol poisoning. Analysis of routine mortality data and of a case-control study of mortality among working-age (25-54 years) men occurring in the Russian city of Izhevsk, west of the Ural mountains, 2003-05. Interviews were carried out with proxy informants for both the dead cases (N = 1750) and the controls (N = 1750) selected at random from a population register. Mortality was analysed according to indicators of alcohol problems. Hazardous drinking was associated with an increased risk of death from circulatory diseases as a whole [odds ratio (OR) = 4.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.23, 5.31] adjusted for age, smoking and education. The association with alcoholic cardiomyopathy was particularly strong (OR = 15.7, 95% CI 9.5, 25.9). Although there was no association with deaths from myocardial infarction (MI; OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.59, 2.32), there was a strong association with the aggregate of all other ischaemic heart disease (IHD; OR = 4.04, 95% CI 2.79, 5.84). Stronger associations for each of these causes (other than MI) were seen with whether or not the man had drunk very heavily in the previous week. However, associations also remained when analyses were restricted to subjects with no evidence of recent heavy drinking, suggesting that misclassification of acute alcohol poisonings is unlikely to explain these overall associations.","Taken as a whole, the available evidence suggests that the positive association of alcohol with increased cardiovascular disease mortality may be best explained as being the result of a combination of chronic and acute alcohol consumption resulting in alcohol-related cardiac disorders, especially cardiomyopathy, rather than being due to misclassification of acute alcohol poisoning. Further work is required to understand the mechanisms underlying the link between heavy alcohol consumption and deaths classified as being due to IHD (other than MI).",closed_qa
Is growth factor Midkine involved in the pathogenesis of renal injury induced by protein overload containing endotoxin?,"Growth factor Midkine (MK), which expresses on endothelial cells and renal proximal tubules, has been implicated in inflammation-related kidney diseases such as ischemic reperfusion-induced tubulointerstitial injury and diabetic nephropathy. The biological actions of MK are elicited through its chemotactic activity and chemokine-driven inflammatory pathway. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is caused by the deposition of immune complexes into glomeruli by infiltrating a number of inflammatory cells. Therefore, we investigated whether MK might be involved in the pathogenesis of acute glomerulonephritis. We induced endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis in 129/SV mice using intraperitoneal injections of a large amount of protein. In contrast to mice deficient in MK (Mdk (-/-)), Mdk (+/+) mice induced by protein overload demonstrated more diffuse cellular proliferation in the mesangial areas and capillary lumens, eventually leading to glomerular damage and tubulointerstitial injury. This pathological observation could be attributable to neutrophil infiltration through the chemotaxis and stimulation of the MK-macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 pathway, but appeared to be due to the MK-related immunoglobulin (Ig)G deposition and C3 activation. These findings are often seen in infectious-related glomerular injury. Furthermore, the profile of MK expression was strongly consistent with that of glomerular damage and tubulointersititial injury.",This study might provide a new insight into understanding the deleterious role of MK in endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis induced by protein overload.,closed_qa
Does direct current reduce wound edema after full-thickness burn injury in rats?,"To observe the effect of 4 and 40 microA direct current (DC) on edema formation after burn injury in rats. Silver-nylon wound dressings were used as either anodes (-) or cathodes (+) on 20% total body surface area full-thickness scalds in anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Untreated burned rats and rats treated with silver-nylon dressings without current were used as controls. Immediately applied, continuous DC reduced burn edema by 17 to 48% at different times up to 48 hours postburn (p < 0.001). Neither reversal of electrode polarity nor change in current density had any significant effect on the results of treatment. Starting treatment during the first 8 hours postburn produced the least edema accumulation, but the reduction was significant even when DC was applied 36 hours afterburn. If started immediately after injury, treatment had to be continued a minimum of 8 hours to be most effective.",Direct electric current has a beneficial effect in reducing wound edema after burn injury.,closed_qa
Does fistula in ano surgery have no impact on pudendal nerve terminal motor latency?,"Anal fistula surgery is recognized as a major risk factor for anal incontinence. This incontinence is mainly due to surgical sphincter lesions, although a neurogenic mechanism through damage to the pudendal nerve is not excluded. The objective of our study was to evaluate the influence of anal surgery on the anal terminal motor latency of the pudendal nerve (PNTML). The PNTML values were measured pre- and postoperatively, respectively, in 33 patients (28 men, 5 women) treated for anal suppuration and 34 patients (21 men, 13 women) undergoing pedicular hemorrhoidectomy using the Milligan and Morgan technique. The average age was 49.6 years in the hemorrhoid group and 45 years in the fistula group (p=0.19). There was no difference in the sex ratio between the two groups (p=0.06). In the anal fistula group, the preoperative mean PNTML was 2.42 (+/-0.46) ms on the infected side and 2.40 (+/-0.42) ms on the healthy side, with a significant difference from the control group's preoperative ipsilateral latencies: 2.73 (+/-0.60) ms (p=0.02, p=0.01). The variations in the postoperative PNTML of the fistula group, both on the healthy side (DeltaPNTML=0.06+/-0.42 ms) and on the diseased side (DeltaPNTML=0.03+/-0.40 ms), are comparable with those of the hemorrhoid group (DeltaPNTML=0.01+/-0.48 ms; p=0.63, p=0.84).","The nervous conduction of the pudendal nerves does not seem to be altered by the presence of an infectious process in the ischiorectal fossa nor by the surgical procedure.

Genotypic and phenotypic diversity in Enterococcus faecalis: is agar invasion a pathogenicity score?,"The main objective of the present study is to analyze different genotypic and phenotypic traits related to virulence in Enterococcus faecalis, as well as evaluated the agar invasion phenotype in a collection of isolates with different clinical origins. Seventy-nine E. faecalis isolates, with invasive and non-invasive clinical origins, have been used in this work. Presence of cytolysin activator (cylA), gelatinase (gelE), surface protein (esp), aggregation substance (asa1), endocarditis antigen (efaA), and collagen-binding protein (ace) have been analyzed by PCR. Phenotypic characterization included gelatinase activity, haemolysin production, biofilm formation and agar invasion. All the isolates tested harboured at least one of the virulence determinants. The 95.5% of isolates from haematologic samples were positive for agar invasion test, significantly higher than isolates from non-invasive diseases. A significant reduction in relative invasion area was observed in three selected agar-invasive strains after 15 serial passages.","It has been observed a significant high prevalence of agar-invasion positive isolates among strains belonged to haematological samples. Agar invasiveness is reduced after adaptation of clinical isolates to laboratory conditions, showing that agar invasion phenotype can be modulate by culture conditions as other virulence factors observed in different bacterial species.",closed_qa
Is memory performance related to amyloid and tau pathology in the hippocampus?,"To determine the relation of amyloid and tau pathology in the hippocampal formation to decline in memory and other cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Regression models were used to relate semiquantitative measurements of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs) at autopsy with antemortem performance in memory, abstract/visuospatial and language domains in two independent samples (n = 41, n = 66) that had repeated neuropsychological measurements before death. In both groups, the number of NFTs in the entorhinal cortex, subiculum and CA1 region was inversely associated with memory performance at the last visit before death. However, the number of amyloid plaques and NTs in the entorhinal cortex was also inversely related to poor memory function. Moreover, as the number of plaques or NTs increased in any region of the hippocampal formation, there was a more rapid decline in memory performance over time; a similar decline was associated with increasing numbers of NFTs in the CA1 or subiculum. In contrast, there was no association between amyloid plaques, NFTs or NTs in the frontal or parietal lobe and performance in memory, nor was there an association between plaques, NFTs or NTs in the hippocampal formation and cognitive functions unrelated to memory.","This study implicates both amyloid deposition and tau pathology in the hippocampus as an early and late cause of decline in memory function over time in AD. Memory performance appears to be specifically related to the amount of amyloid plaques, NFTs and NTs in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.",closed_qa
Does almotriptan improve response rates when treatment is within 1 hour of migraine onset?,"Results from open-label trials with almotriptan and sumatriptan have shown higher response rates when treatment was initiated early after acute migraine onset. To investigate the temporal component of early intervention by measuring 2-hour pain-free and sustained pain-free responses to almotriptan and sumatriptan when the study drug was taken within 1 hour of onset of moderate to severe pain. This was a post hoc analysis from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of almotriptan and sumatriptan. Men and women, 18 to 65 years of age, who met International Headache Society criteria for migraine with or without aura were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive a single oral dose of almotriptan 12.5 or 25 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, or placebo at the onset of a severe or moderate migraine attack. For this post hoc analysis, the almotriptan 25-mg dose was excluded because 12.5 mg is the recommended dose. The primary efficacy assessment was sustained pain-free, defined as pain-free at 2 hours postdose with no recurrence from 2 to 24 hours and no use of rescue medication. Only patients who took study medication within 1 hour of migraine onset were included in the analysis. Of the 475 patients involved in the original study, 253 (53.3%) initiated treatment within the 0- to 1-hour interval. For these patients, 2-hour pain-free rates were 37.9% for almotriptan 12.5 mg (P=.016 versus placebo), 35.7% for sumatriptan 100 mg (P=.028 versus placebo), and 18.9% for placebo. Only almotriptan was significantly higher than placebo on the sustained pain-free rate-34.7% (P=.022 versus placebo); the sustained pain-free rate for sumatriptan was 29.6% and for placebo, 17.0%.","Initiation of treatment with almotriptan 12.5 mg within the first hour after acute migraine onset resulted in a significantly higher sustained pain-free response compared with placebo. There was no significant difference in sustained pain-free rates between sumatriptan and placebo. These results are consistent with those from a previous open-label trial, and suggest that early intervention with almotriptan can improve clinical outcome.",closed_qa
Is the correlation between fetal oxygen saturation and blood pH sufficient for the use of fetal pulse oximetry?,"Fetal pulse oximetry was performed during labor in high-risk cases for fetal distress to determine the diagnostic value of this method. The fetal SpO2 values were blinded from the obstetrician so that these values did not influence clinical decisions. Mean and lowest SpO2 measurements for the last 30 min prior to either fetal scalp blood sampling or delivery were correlated with scalp pH or pH from the umbilical artery. No significant correlation was found between pH and mean fetal oxygen saturation (correlation coefficient -0.02, p = 0.9). There was no significant correlation between pH and lowest fetal oxygen saturation (correlation coefficient 0.04, p = 0.84). Concerning the feasibility of the method, we found that only 23 of 65 included patients were suitable for analysis; in 20% of cases, we were not able to perform a SpO2 measurement.","None of three cases with pH below 7.05 would have been detected using mean SpO2 over the last 30 min prior to fetal scalp blood sampling or delivery. Only one case would have been detected using the lowest SpO2 measurement over this period. We conclude that fetal SpO2 measurements during labor are of poor diagnostic value, with a disappointing feasibility and therefore are not ready for implementing into daily clinical practice.",closed_qa
Cancer of the esophagus and cardia: does age influence treatment selection and surgical outcomes?,"Some physicians believe that an aggressive surgical approach for the management of cancer of the esophagus and cardia is unwise in elderly patients because of allegedly higher rates of mortality and morbidity and lower rates of survival than those associated with younger patients. We have long advocated an aggressive surgical approach regardless of the patient's age and have reviewed our experience to determine whether age was a factor influencing treatment and outcomes. From January 1, 1970 to January 1, 1997, 505 patients with cancer of the esophagus or cardia underwent operations by one surgical team using standard surgical techniques. One hundred forty-seven patients (29.1%) were 70 years of age or older and 358 patients (70.9%) were under 70 years of age. Their records and clinicopathologic features were reviewed and compared. The two groups were similar regarding the location of tumors. Tumor cell types were similar except for adenocarcinomas in Barrett's esophagus, which were less common in the older group (15.6% versus 24%; p=0.046). Surgical procedures were similar, as were the rates of resectability and the percentages of R0 resections. The hospital mortality rate was higher in the elderly patients but not significantly so, and the rates of major and minor complications combined were comparable. The differences in postresection pathologic staging were not significant. Satisfactory palliation of dysphagia was comparable between the groups, as were actuarial 5-year survival rates (24.1% of the elderly patients versus 22.4% of the younger patients).","Age should not be a limiting factor in using an aggressive surgical approach for the management of cancer of the esophagus or cardia in patients aged 70 years or older. Such an approach can be performed as safely as in younger patients, with comparable rates of palliation and survival.",closed_qa
Do the effect of calcium hydroxide on the antibiotic component of Odontopaste and Ledermix paste?,"To investigate the chemical interaction of calcium hydroxide with the antibiotics demeclocycline calcium in Ledermix Paste and clindamycin hydrochloride in Odontopaste. Validated methods were developed to analyse the interaction of calcium hydroxide in two forms, Pulpdent and calcium hydroxide powder, with the two antibiotics. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyse the mixed samples of the pastes and calcium hydroxide. The concentration of demeclocycline calcium over 0-, 1-, 18-, 24-, 72-h and 7-day time-points was determined. The concentration of clindamycin hydrochloride over 1-, 6-, 24-, 72-h and 7-day time-points was determined. All tests with HPLC involved testing of the standard in duplicate alongside the samples. Linearity, precision and specificity of the testing procedures and apparatus were validated. Descriptive statistics are provided. The antibiotics in both Odontopaste and Ledermix Paste were affected by the addition of calcium hydroxide. When mixed with calcium hydroxide powder, Odontopaste had a 2% loss of clindamycin hydrochloride over 7 days, but when mixed with Pulpdent, there was a 36% loss over 7 days. Ledermix Paste showed an 80% loss of demeclocycline calcium over 7 days when mixed with calcium hydroxide powder and a 19% loss when mixed with Pulpdent over the 7-day period.",The addition of calcium hydroxide to Odontopaste or Ledermix Paste results in reductions of the respective antibiotic over a 7-day time period.,closed_qa
Serum cystatin C: a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis or of current liver fibrogenesis in chronic hepatitis C?,"Serum levels of cystatin C, an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, provide an alternative method to creatinine-based criteria for measuring glomerular filtration rate. Preliminary data suggested that serum cystatin C levels parallel with the stage of liver fibrosis in chronic liver disorders. Our aim has been to evaluate the possible role of serum cystatin C as a marker of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced chronic liver disease. 100 consecutive patients (56 men, mean age 51.2 ± 9.5 yrs) with HCV-induced chronic liver disease, scheduled for their first liver biopsy and naïve for antiviral therapy were included. Liver fibrosis was evaluated with the METAVIR score. Serum cystatin C and standard laboratory tests were measured simultaneously. Patients with ethanol abuse (>50 g/day), HBV or HIV coinfection or plasma creatinine ≥ 1.20 mg/dL were excluded. In addition, a second group of 16 patients fulfilling the same requisites and diagnosed with HCV-induced compensated cirrhosis by clinical evidence of portal hypertension was included. Serum cystatin C levels significantly increase from F0 to F2 fibrosis stages, remained stable in F3 and F4 stages and increased again in the group of non-biopsied compensated cirrhosis. Serum cystatin C levels were higher in patients with moderate-advanced necroinflammation in the liver biopsy.",Serum cystatin C level may reflect current fibrogenic and necroinflammatory activities in chronic HCV-induced liver disease with normal renal function but can not be considered as a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis.,closed_qa
Does early Postnatal NT-3 Gene Delivery enhance Hearing Acquisition in the Developmental Period?,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of early postnatal neurotrophin-3 (NT3) support on hearing acquisition. A prospective experimental animal study. Adenoviral (Ad) vectors expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) alone or in combination with NT3 were injected into the scala tympani through the round window of 5-postnatal-day-old (P5) rats. Changes in NT3 mRNA level, hearing thresholds, and morphological studies were done after the viral vector injection. NT3 mRNA was significantly increased in the Ad-GFP-NT3 group compared to the normal-developmental group and Ad-GFP alone group. GFP was widely expressed in the cochlea such as in the hair cells, supporting cell area, and spiral ganglion neurons. Auditory brainstem response thresholds were significantly lower in the Ad-GFP-NT3 group compared to the normal-developmental group and Ad-GFP alone group at P15.",These results show that early postnatal NT3 overexpression may accelerate the acquisition of hearing in rats.,closed_qa
Do mesenchymal stem cells enhance survival and bacterial clearance in murine Escherichia coli pneumonia?,"Bacterial pneumonia is the most common infectious cause of death worldwide and treatment is increasingly hampered by antibiotic resistance. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to provide protection against acute inflammatory lung injury; however, their potential therapeutic role in the setting of bacterial pneumonia has not been well studied. This study focused on testing the therapeutic and mechanistic effects of MSCs in a mouse model of Gram-negative pneumonia. Syngeneic MSCs from wild-type mice were isolated and administered via the intratracheal route to mice 4 h after the mice were infected with Escherichia coli. 3T3 fibroblasts and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as controls for all in vivo experiments. Survival, lung injury, bacterial counts and indices of inflammation were measured in each treatment group. Treatment with wild-type MSCs improved 48 h survival (MSC, 55%; 3T3, 8%; PBS, 0%; p<0.05 for MSC vs 3T3 and PBS groups) and lung injury compared with control mice. In addition, wild-type MSCs enhanced bacterial clearance from the alveolar space as early as 4 h after administration, an effect that was not observed with the other treatment groups. The antibacterial effect with MSCs was due, in part, to their upregulation of the antibacterial protein lipocalin 2.","Treatment with MSCs enhanced survival and bacterial clearance in a mouse model of Gram-negative pneumonia.

Does xanthoceraside attenuate tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive deficits in intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin injected rats?,"Xanthoceraside, a novel triterpenoid saponin extracted from the fruit husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge, reverses cognitive deficits in intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ25-35 or Aβ1-42 mice. However, whether xanthoceraside has a positive effect on hyperphosphorylated tau protein remains unclear. We investigated the effects of xanthoceraside on behavioural impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in rats and its potential mechanisms. The rats were administered with xanthoceraside (0.06, 0.12 or 0.24 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily after STZ intracerebroventricular injections. The Y-maze test and novel object recognition test were performed 21 and 22 days after the second STZ injection, respectively. The levels of hyperphosphorylated tau, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP-2A) were also tested by Western blot. Xanthoceraside treatment significantly attenuated learning and memory impairments and reduced the level of STZ-induced hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Xanthoceraside also enhanced PP-2A and PP-1 expressions, increased PI3K (p85) and Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation and decreased GSK-3β (tyr216) phosphorylation.","Xanthoceraside has protective effect against learning and memory impairments and inhibits tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus, possibly through the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-dependent GSK-3β signalling pathway and an enhancement of phosphatases activity.",closed_qa
Are dnaK and GroEL chaperones recruited to the Bacillus subtilis membrane after short-term ethanol stress?,"To find out membrane tolerance strategy to ethanol in Bacillus subtilis that possesses a powerful system of protection against environmental stresses. Cytoplasmic membranes of B. subtilis were severely affected by even short-term exposure to 3% (v/v) ethanol: the growth rate and membrane protein synthesis were markedly reduced, and no adaptive alterations in phospholipids were detected. Simultaneously, steady-state DPH fluorescence anisotropy (r(ss)) showed that the membrane rigidity increased substantially. Analysis of the membrane phosphoproteome using in vitro labelling with [γ-(32) P]ATP revealed the association of DnaK and GroEL chaperones with membrane, indicating a stress induction process. Upon a long-term 3% (v/v) ethanol stress, the cell growth accelerated slightly and the composition of polar head groups and fatty acids of membrane phospholipids underwent an extensive reconstruction. Correspondingly, membrane fluidity turned back to the original r(ss) values of the control cells.","In B. subtilis, the adaptive response to short-term ethanol stress comprises the recruitment of molecular chaperones on the impaired membrane structure; consequently, the phospholipid synthesis is restored and membrane fluidity adapts properly to the continuing ethanol stress.",closed_qa
Does cSF cytology have limited value in the evaluation of patients with ependymoma who have MRI evidence of metastasis?,"To investigate the usefulness of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology in pediatric patients with ependymoma who relapsed after focal irradiation. Eighty-eight patients with ependymoma received conformal radiotherapy (CRT) from July 1997 through January 2003 on an IRB approved prospective treatment protocol. CSF cytology results from evaluations performed prior to CRT and at the time of failure were reviewed for patients who progressed after CRT as documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-two patients had MRI documented evidence of progression after CRT. Ten patients developed distant failure without local failure, four had combined local and distant failure and eight had local failure without distant failure. The median time from the start of CRT to progression was 19 months (range: 6-73). CSF cytology at diagnosis was negative for the presence of malignant cells in all patients. At the time of progression, CSF cytology was performed in 16 of 22 patients including all 10 patients with distant failure without local recurrence. Malignant cells were not found in any of the evaluated CSF specimens including those with distant failure documented by MRI.",CSF cytology does not add valuable information when evaluating patients with ependymoma who have evidence of distant failure documented by MRI.

Does cardiac morphology predict plasma brain natriuretic Peptide levels in adolescent athletes?,"The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship of plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to physiologic parameters and cardiac morphologic characteristics in a population of young athletes. Our hypothesis is that physiologic and cardiac morphologic characteristics do not predict BNP levels in adolescent athletes. Observational study. Outpatient hospital. Thirty healthy male adolescent high school football players (16.0 +/- 1.1 years). Physical exam, electrocardiography, plasma BNP measurement by rapid fluorescent immunoassay, and limited echocardiography. Null hypothesis-physiologic parameters and cardiac morphology do not predict plasma BNP levels in healthy adolescent football players. Significance level set at P<0.05. Plasma BNP for this population was 11.9 +/- 10.2 pg/mL.

Is sTAT3 NH2-terminal acetylation activated by the hepatic acute-phase response and required for IL-6 induction of angiotensinogen?,"The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are cytoplasmic transcription factors mediating acute-phase response (APR) of the human angiotensinogen (hAGT) gene in hepatocytes. The mechanisms of how STAT3 activates target genes are unknown. Here we analyzed the biochemistry of STAT3 activation by interleukin (IL)-6 in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and Balb/C mice. Immunoprecipitation-Western assays and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Time of Flight mass spectrometry determined sites of STAT3 acetylation by the 300-kilodalton target of E1A (p300) co-activator. The subcellular localization of acetylation-deficient STAT3 molecules were studied by microscopic imaging, effects on DNA binding measured by gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and gene transactivation by Northern blot and reporter assays. Two Lys residues at amino acids 49 and 87 in the STAT3 NH2 terminus are acetylated by p300. Lys-to-Arg point mutations (STAT3 K49R/K87R) had no effect on inducible DNA binding, but blocked p300-mediated acetyl(Ac)-STAT3 formation and abrogated IL-6-induced hAGT activation. Although STAT3 K49R/K87R rapidly translocated into the nucleus, it did not bind p300 and had delayed cytoplasmic redistribution. ChIP assays show IL-6-inducible acetylated STAT3 and p300 binding to the native hAGT promoter. Activation of the APR in mice induces nuclear Tyr phosphorylated and acetylated STAT3 in hepatic nuclei. We also observed that STAT3 interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically HDAC 1, that down-regulate IL-6-induced hAGT transactivation.","IL-6-induced target gene activation requires p300-mediated STAT3 acetylation, and HDACs are involved in the termination of STAT3 action. These studies indicate the acetylation-deacetylation reaction as a novel signaling mechanism controlling the IL-6-STAT3 pathway in the hepatic APR.",closed_qa
Do insulin-like growth factor 1-coated sutures improve anastomotic healing in an experimental model of colitis?,": Exogenously applied insulin-like growth factor (rhIGF-1) may improve normal intestinal healing. This study examined the effect of rhIGF-1-coated sutures on anastomotic healing in experimental colitis. : Acute colitis was induced in rats by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). Inflammation was assessed by clinical Disease Activity Index (DAI), myeloperoxidase (MPO) measurement and histological examination. A distal colonic anastomosis was performed using sutures coated with rhIGF-1 dissolved in poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) under general anaesthetic. Anastomotic healing was evaluated histologically, and by hydroxyproline measurement and bursting parameters after 1, 3 and 7 days, and compared with healthy, DSS and DSS + PDLLA controls. : DAI, MPO and histological inflammation scores were significantly increased in all animals treated with DSS. Bursting occurred less often within the anastomotic line on day 3 in the IGF group than in DSS controls (three versus eight of ten). On day 7, the IGF group had significantly increased histological healing scores (mean(s.e.m.) 12.5(0.7) versus 9.2(0.8) (P < 0.050)) and hydroxyproline content (4.6(0.3) versus 3.6(0.1) mg/g tissue; P < 0.050) compared with DSS controls.",: IGF-1-coated sutures improve important aspects of anastomotic healing in rats with experimental colitis.,closed_qa
Does the addition of oxaliplatin to preoperative chemoradiation benefit cT4 or fixed cT3 rectal cancer treatment?,"Whether there is any benefit derived from adding oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based preoperative chemoradiation is currently unknown in cases of advanced cT3 or cT4 tumours. Our aim was to evaluate this issue by analysing a randomized trial, which compared two schedules of preoperative treatment (chemoradiation vs. 5 × 5 Gy with 3 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy) for cT4 or fixed cT3 rectal cancer. Delivery of oxaliplatin was mandatory to the first part of the study. For the second part, its delivery in both treatment-assigned groups was left to the discretion of the local investigator. We analysed a subgroup of 272 patients (136 in the oxaliplatin group and 136 in the fluorouracil-only group) from institutions that had omitted oxaliplatin in the second part of the study. Circumferential resection margin negative (CRM-) status rate was 68% in the oxaliplatin group and 70% in the fluorouracil-only group, p = 0.72. The pathological complete response rate (pCR) was correspondingly 14% vs. 7%, p = 0.10. Following multivariable analysis, when comparing the CRM- status in the oxaliplatin group to the fluorouracil-only group, the odds ratio was 0.79 (95 CI 0.35-1.74), p = 0.54; there being no interaction between concomitant chemoradiation and 5 × 5 Gy with consolidation chemotherapy; pinteraction = 0.073.

Is a change in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide predictive of outcome in patients with advanced heart failure?,"The prognosis of chronic heart failure has improved with modern medical therapy. However, identifying those patients who fail to respond to such therapy and therefore those who remain at high risk is notoriously difficult. The B-type natriuretic peptides are established independent predictors of prognosis in CHF. However, the relevance of a change in NT-proBNP concentration over time in advanced heart failure is unknown. We prospectively studied 133 patients with advanced CHF referred for consideration of cardiac transplantation. Plasma for NT-proBNP analysis was sampled at baseline and a median of 4 months later in the 112 patients surviving without cardiac transplantation. Patients were followed up for a median of 1003 days. The primary endpoint of all-cause mortality occurred in 30 (26.8%) patients. Those subjects who had the highest NT-proBNP concentration at 4 months were at the greatest risk of death (log rank statistic=10.4, p=0.001). On Cox regression analysis, both a NT-proBNP concentration above the median and an absolute increase in NT-proBNP were independent predictors of mortality (chi(2)=53, p<0.0001 and chi(2)=17.3, p<0.0001, respectively).",A single NT-proBNP concentration above the median and a change in NT-proBNP concentration over a 4-month period were independent predictors of mortality in patients with advanced heart failure.,closed_qa
Is increased plasma UCH-L1 after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with unfavorable neurological outcome?,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a common cause of long-term disability and death. After primary hemorrhage, secondary brain injury is the main cause of mortality and morbidity. Despite extensive research, reliable prognostic biomarkers are lacking. We measured ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) levels in aSAH patients to evaluate its prognostic potential. This is the first time that plasma UCH-L1 has been studied as a potential prognostic biomarker in patients with aSAH. In this prospective population-based study, UCH-L1 levels were measured in aSAH patients (n=47) for up to five days. UCH-L1 was measured at 0, 12 and 24h after the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and daily thereafter until the patient was transferred from the ICU. Only patients whose UCH-L1 was measured within 24h from aSAH were included in the study. The patients' neurological outcome was evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at six months after aSAH. UCH-L1 levels during the first 24h after aSAH were not significantly different between the groups with favorable (mRS 0-2) and unfavorable (mRS 3-6) neurological outcome. In 22 patients, UCH-L1 levels were obtained for up to five days. In this subgroup, UCH-L1 measured at day five showed significant elevation from baseline levels in patients with unfavorable outcome (p=0.026). Elevated UCH-L1 levels at day five were higher in patients with unfavorable outcome than in patients with favorable outcome (p=0.001).",Elevated UCH-L1 levels during the five-day follow-up were associated with unfavorable neurological outcome. Repetitive measurements of UCH-L1 concentrations with an emphasis on change relative to the individual baseline could be the optimal approach for future clinical studies.,closed_qa
Is iL-4 gene transcription in human T cells suppressed by T-bet?,"T-bet is crucially implicated in Th1 differentiation due to its strong promoting activity for IFN-gamma gene transcription. However, the regulatory role of T-bet in Th2 cytokines is not fully delineated. The effect of T-bet on mRNA expression as well as the promoter activity of IL-4 in human T cells was investigated by employing quantitative RT-PCR and fluorescence-based promoter reporter assay procedures. IL-4 mRNA expression as well as the transcriptional activity of 5'-flanking region in the IL-4 gene encompassing -1105 to +4 in Jurkat cells was clearly upregulated upon stimulation. The inducible mRNA expression and the promoter activity of IL-4 were significantly diminished by ectopic expression of T-bet.","IL-4 gene transcription is inhibited by T-bet via the suppression of its promoter activity, independently of IFN-gamma. T-bet facilitates Th1 differentiation through not only upregulation of IFN-gamma, but also downregulation of IL-4 gene transcription.",closed_qa
Is a putative functional variant within the UBAC2 gene associated with increased risk of Behçet 's disease?,"Using a genome-wide association scan and DNA pooling, we previously identified 5 novel genetic susceptibility loci for Behçet's disease. We undertook this study to establish the genetic effect within the UBAC2 gene, in the course of which we replicated this genetic association and identified a functional variant within this locus. We studied a total of 676 Behçet's disease patients and 1,096 controls. The discovery set included 156 patients and 167 controls from Turkey, and the replication sets included 376 patients and 369 controls from Turkey and 144 patients and 560 controls from Italy. Genotyping of 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and around UBAC2 was performed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. The genetic association between Behçet's disease and UBAC2 was established, replicated, and confirmed (meta-analysis odds ratio 1.84, P = 1.69 × 10(-7) ). Haplotype analysis identified both a disease-risk haplotype and a protective haplotype (P = 0.00014 and P = 0.0075, respectively). Using conditional haplotype analysis, we identified the SNP rs7999348 (A/G) within UBAC2 as the most likely SNP with a genetic effect independent of the haplotypic effect formed by the remaining associated SNPs in this locus. Indeed, we demonstrated that rs7999348 tags a functional variant associated with increased messenger RNA expression of a UBAC2 transcript variant in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals homozygous for the Behçet's disease-associated ""G"" allele. Further, our data suggested the possibility of multiple genetic effects that increase susceptibility to Behçet's disease in the UBAC2 locus.",We established and confirmed the genetic association between UBAC2 and Behçet's disease in 3 independent sets of patients and controls.

Physicians' attitudes toward preventive therapy for coronary artery disease: is there a gender bias?,"While much of the gender difference in the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) results from the fact that the women being treated are older and have more comorbidities, it remains to be established whether a true gender bias exists. We compared physicians' attitudes and practice toward preventive therapy in men and women with CAD. Physicians perceive the prevention of CAD in men as more important than in women. In the ""attitude study,"" we obtained data on the attitudes of 172 physicians toward treatment, using hypothetical case histories of 58-year-old male and postmenopausal female patients with identical clinical and laboratory data and mild coronary atherosclerosis on angiography. In the ""actual practice study,"" we evaluated the lipoprotein levels and prescription of lipid-lowering medications from medical records of 344 male and female patients with angiographic evidence of CAD. In the hypothetical case histories, physicians in general considered the male patient to be at higher risk and prescribed aspirin (91 vs. 77%, p<0.01) and lipid-lowering medications (67 vs. 54%, p<0.07) more often for the male patient. Evaluation of medical charts of patients with CAD revealed that in patients with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol>110 mg/dl, 77% of the males received a lipid-lowering medication, compared with only 47% of the female patients (p<0.001).","We found evidence for a gender bias in the attitude as well as in actual practice of secondary prevention toward patients with CAD.

Does transcriptome analysis of the spalax hypoxia survival response include suppression of apoptosis and tight control of angiogenesis?,"The development of complex responses to hypoxia has played a key role in the evolution of mammals, as inadequate response to this condition is frequently associated with cardiovascular diseases, developmental disorders, and cancers. Though numerous studies have used mice and rats in order to explore mechanisms that contribute to hypoxia tolerance, these studies are limited due to the high sensitivity of most rodents to severe hypoxia. The blind subterranean mole rat Spalax is a hypoxia tolerant rodent, which exhibits unique longevity and therefore has invaluable potential in hypoxia and cancer research. Using microarrays, transcript abundance was measured in brain and muscle tissues from Spalax and rat individuals exposed to acute and chronic hypoxia for varying durations. We found that Spalax global gene expression response to hypoxia differs from that of rat and is characterized by the activation of functional groups of genes that have not been strongly associated with the response to hypoxia in hypoxia sensitive mammals. Using functional enrichment analysis of Spalax hypoxia induced genes we found highly significant overrepresentation of groups of genes involved in anti apoptosis, cancer, embryonic/sexual development, epidermal growth factor receptor binding, coordinated suppression and activation of distinct groups of transcription factors and membrane receptors, in addition to angiogenic related processes. We also detected hypoxia induced increases of different critical Spalax hub gene transcripts, including antiangiogenic genes associated with cancer tolerance in Down syndrome human individuals.","This is the most comprehensive study of Spalax large scale gene expression response to hypoxia to date, and the first to use custom Spalax microarrays. Our work presents novel patterns that may underlie mechanisms with critical importance to the evolution of hypoxia tolerance, with special relevance to medical research.",closed_qa
Does bradykinin mediate remote ischaemic preconditioning or ischaemia-reperfusion injury in vivo in man?,"To examine whether endogenous bradykinin mediates the endothelium-dependent vasomotor dysfunction induced by ischaemia-reperfusion injury, or the protection afforded by remote ischaemic preconditioning in vivo in man. Randomised double-blind, cross-over study. Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility. Twenty healthy male volunteers. Subjects were randomised to intravenous infusion of the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, HOE-140 (100 μg/kg), or saline placebo in a double-blind, crossover trial. Ischaemia-reperfusion injury was induced in the non-dominant arm by inflating a cuff to 200 mm Hg for 20 min in all subjects. Ischaemia-reperfusion injury was preceded by three cycles of remote ischaemic preconditioning in the dominant arm in 10 subjects. Bilateral forearm blood flow was assessed using venous occlusion plethysmography during intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (5-20 μg/min). Acetylcholine caused vasodilatation in all studies (p<0.05) that was attenuated by ischaemia-reperfusion injury, both in the presence (p=0.0002) and absence (p=0.04) of HOE-140. Remote ischaemic preconditioning abolished the impairment of endothelium-dependent vasomotor function induced by ischaemia-reperfusion injury.

Do cardiac magnetic resonance parameters predict transplantation-free survival in patients with fontan circulation?,"Several clinical risk factors for death and heart transplantation have been identified in patients with Fontan circulation. It is unknown whether cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) measurements of ventricular size and function are independently associated with these outcomes and further improve risk stratification. Data on patients with Fontan circulation who had a CMR study from January 2002 to January 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The end point was time to death or listing for heart transplantation after the CMR study. The median age of the 215 patients was 18.3 years (25th, 75th percentiles: 14, 26) with a median age at Fontan of 3.6 years (2.3, 7.1). During a median post-CMR follow-up period of 4.1 years (2.6, 6.2), 24 patients (11%) reached the end point: 20 deaths, 3 transplantations, and 1 transplantation listing. In a multivariable Cox regression model with clinical parameters only, protein-losing enteropathy was associated with transplantation-free survival. A multivariable model, including clinical and CMR parameters, showed that in addition to protein-losing enteropathy, ventricular indexed end-diastolic volume >125 mL/body surface area raised to the 1.3 power was associated with transplantation-free survival. A likelihood-ratio test comparing the 2 models showed that the addition of indexed end-diastolic volume resulted in a significantly improved end point prediction (P<0.001)-C-index increased from 0.63 to 0.79.",CMR-derived ventricular indexed end-diastolic volume is an independent predictor of transplantation-free survival in patients late after the Fontan operation and adds incremental value over clinical symptoms alone for risk stratification.,closed_qa
Anti-lipoprotein lipase antibodies: a new player in the complex atherosclerotic process in systemic lupus erythematosus?,"The novel description of antibodies to lipoprotein lipase (anti-LPL) associated with dyslipoproteinemia prompted us to analyze the association of anti-LPL with clinical and serologic features in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its link to markers of inflammation that are known to be involved in atherogenesis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test for the presence of anti-LPL antibodies in 66 consecutive patients with SLE. Clinical and laboratory evaluation, including a fasting lipid profile, autoantibody screening, an assessment for markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) were performed at the time of inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria were any conditions that affect the lipid profile. SLE patients were categorized into 2 groups according to detection of these anti-LPL antibodies, as follows: anti-LPL+ and anti-LPL-. Anti-LPL antibody IgG was detected in 25 SLE patients (37.8%). Triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the anti-LPL+ group (112.4 +/- 50.2 versus 89.9 +/- 54.5 mg/dl in the anti-LPL- group; P = 0.033), but no significant differences between the 2 groups were detected for total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. A higher frequency of elevated CRP levels and ESRs was observed in the anti-LPL+ group compared with the anti-LPL- group (44% and 17.1%, respectively [P = 0.023] and 52% and 19.5%, respectively [P = 0.013]). Moreover, SLE patients with anti-LPL antibodies also had significantly higher levels of CRP (11.1 +/- 16.4 versus 2.4 +/- 2.6 mug/ml; P = 0.036) and higher ESRs (33.4 +/- 29.8 versus 16.5 +/- 11.8 mm/hour; P = 0.020). Anti-LPL titers had a significant positive correlation with the CRP level (r = 0.56, P<0.001), the ESR (r = 0.55, P<0.001), the SLEDAI score (r = 0.45, P<0.001), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA; r = 0.52, P<0.001), and anticardiolipin IgG antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.04), and a significant negative correlation was detected with total hemolytic complement activity (CH100) (r = -0.34, P = 0.005). Reinforcing these findings, multiple regression analysis also revealed a significant association of anti-LPL with the CRP level (P = 0.025) and anti-dsDNA (P<0.001). Importantly, a comparison of positive and negative anti-dsDNA sera revealed similar mean CRP levels (P = 0.56) and ESRs (P = 0.102), contrasting with the SLEDAI score (P = 0.004) and CH100 (P = 0.008).","These data support the link between inflammation, immune response, and dyslipoproteinemia in SLE, introducing anti-LPL as a possible new player that may ultimately help in understanding the complex events of atherogenesis in this disease.",closed_qa
Do autoimmune Comorbidities Are Associated with Brain Injury in Multiple Sclerosis?,"The effect of comorbidities on disease severity in MS has not been extensively characterized. We determined the association of comorbidities with MR imaging disease severity outcomes in MS. Demographic and clinical history of 9 autoimmune comorbidities confirmed by retrospective chart review and quantitative MR imaging data were obtained in 815 patients with MS. The patients were categorized on the basis of the presence/absence of total and specific comorbidities. We analyzed the MR imaging findings, adjusting for key covariates and correcting for multiple comparisons. Two hundred forty-one (29.6%) study subjects presented with comorbidities.

Patients with MS with comorbidities showed decreased whole-brain and cortical volumes (P < .001), gray matter volume and magnetization transfer ratio of normal-appearing brain tissue (P < .01), and magnetization transfer ratio of gray matter (P < .05). Psoriasis, thyroid disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus comorbidities were associated with decreased whole-brain, cortical, and gray matter volumes (P < .05). Psoriasis was associated with a decreased magnetization transfer ratio of normal-appearing brain tissue (P < .05), while type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with increased mean diffusivity (P < .01).","The presence of comorbidities in patients with MS is associated with brain injury on MR imaging.

Narcolepsy in Singapore: is it an elusive disease?,"The aims of the study were to determine the demographic, clinical, and polysomnographic characteristics of narcolepsy, and to address the difficulties in diagnosing narcolepsy and cataplexy, which is a cardinal symptom. We also ventured to investigate the differences between narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Data were collected retrospectively from patients diagnosed with narcolepsy at the Sleep Disorder Unit of Singapore General Hospital over 5 years. Each patient had had a detailed clinical evaluation and overnight polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). A total of 28 cases were studied. Males made up 85.7% of the total and females, 14.3%. The mean age was 30.9 years. All had excessive daytime sleepiness. Other manifestations were cataplexy (48.1%), sleep paralysis (51.9%), hypnogogic hallucinations (84%), disturbed night sleep (29.2%), automatisms (17.4%) and catnaps (95.8%). The mean duration of symptoms was 7.24 years. In the MSLT, the mean values for mean sleep latency and number of sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMP) were 4.3 minutes and 2.7, respectively. Narcolepsy was associated with obstructive sleep apnoea and periodic limb movement disorder (35.7%). All the variables were compared between those who had narcolepsy with cataplexy and without cataplexy. The duration of presenting complaint, REM latency, respiratory disturbance index, number of SOREMPs and the presence of sleep paralysis were significantly different in the 2 groups.",Narcolepsy predominantly affects young males. Concurrence of other sleep disorders is not uncommon. Some differences are evident between those who have narcolepsy with and without cataplexy.,closed_qa
Can the endometrial thickness as measured by trans-vaginal sonography be used to exclude polyps or hyperplasia in pre-menopausal patients with abnormal uterine bleeding?,"To combine findings of normal mid-line echoes from TVS (trans-vaginal sonography) with cut-off levels for endometrial thickness, in order to examine the associated risk of abnormalities in the uterine cavity. Two center prospective study at a university clinic and a central hospital in Denmark. Three hundred and fifty-five pre-menopausal patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, and indications for endometrial sampling or surgery. The thickness of the endometrium was measured, and the mid-line echoes were evaluated using TVS. The findings from the endometrial sampling, combined with the evaluation of the uterine cavity using operative hysteroscopy (115), hysterectomy (74) or HSE (hysterosonographic examination) (166), were used as the true values. The mean (+/-s.d.) endometrial thickness was significantly different in patients with hyperplasia 11.5 mm (+/-5.0), polyps 11.8 mm (+/-5.1), sub-mucous myomas 7.1 mm (+/-3.4) and in patients without these abnormalities 8.37 (+/-3.9) (p<0.001). Hyperplasia and/or polyps were present in 20% of all patients, and in 8% of 143 patients with an endometrial thickness of<or =7 mm. This proportion did not decrease with lower cut-off levels for endometrial thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were not optimal for excluding hyperplasia or polyps by endometrial thickness. In 173 cases with a distinct, regular midline echo without echo-dense foci in TVS the proportion of patients with abnormalities was 16% (11-23). This proportion did not decrease with cut-off levels for endometrial thickness.","Using TVS, low levels of endometrial thickness reduced the possibility of abnormalities such as polyps and hyperplasia, but did not exclude them. Low cut-off levels for endometrial thickness did not increase the diagnostic performance in cases with normal sonograms.",closed_qa
Do mesalazine and thymoquinone attenuate intestinal tumour development in Msh2 ( loxP/loxP ) Villin-Cre mice?,"Lynch syndrome is caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes leading to microsatellite instability (MSI) and colorectal cancer. Mesalazine, commonly used for the treatment of UC, reduces MSI in vitro. Here, we tested natural compounds for such activity and applied mesalazine and thymoquinone in a Msh2(loxP/loxP) Villin-Cre mouse model for Lynch syndrome. Flow cytometry was used for quantitation of mutation rates at a CA13 microsatellite in human colon cancer (HCT116) cells that had been stably transfected with pIREShyg2-enhanced green fluorescent protein/CA13, a reporter for frameshift mutations. Mice were treated for 43 weeks with mesalazine, thymoquinone or control chow. Intestines were analysed for tumour incidence, tumour multiplicity and size. MSI testing was performed from microdissected normal intestinal or tumour tissue, compared with mouse tails and quantified by the number of mutations per marker (NMPM). Besides mesalazine, thymoquinone significantly improved replication fidelity at 1.25 and 2.5 µM in HCT116 cells. In Msh2(loxP/loxP) Villin-Cre mice, tumour incidence was reduced by mesalazine from 94% to 69% (p=0.04) and to 56% (p=0.003) by thymoquinone. The mean number of tumours was reduced from 3.1 to 1.4 by mesalazine (p=0.004) and to 1.1 by thymoquinone (p<0.001). Interestingly, MSI was reduced in normal intestinal tissue from 1.5 to 1.2 NMPM (p=0.006) and to 1.1 NMPM (p=0.01) by mesalazine and thymoquinone, respectively. Thymoquinone, but not mesalazine, reduced MSI in tumours.",Mesalazine and thymoquinone reduce tumour incidence and multiplicity in Msh2(loxP/loxP) Villin-Cre mice by reduction of MSI independent of a functional mismatch repair system.

Is osteocalcin higher across pregnancy in Caucasian women with gestational diabetes mellitus?,"The purpose of this study was to investigate circulating concentrations of osteocalcin, a bone-derived protein, while accounting for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) throughout pregnancy, and whether early gestation concentrations and changes in osteocalcin predict the subsequent diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This was a nested case-control study involving 48 GDM and 48 control pregnant Caucasian women (matched for age, season of conception, pre-pregnancy body mass index and pregnancy length). Maternal serum osteocalcin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 25(OH)D by chemiluminescence throughout pregnancy (11-13 weeks, 24-28 weeks and predelivery). Differences between groups were compared by mixed model analysis of variance. Predictors of diagnosis of GDM were explored using generalized estimating equation models. Neonatal general health outcomes were also compared between groups. Serum osteocalcin was higher across pregnancy (p=0.006) in women with GDM vs. controls, whereas serum 25(OH)D was not different (p=0.80). Both biomarkers increased with time across pregnancy (p<0.0001). However, serum osteocalcin during early pregnancy and changes in its concentration from early to mid gestation did not predict the development of GDM. There were no significant differences in anthropometry and APGAR (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration) scores in neonates of controls and cases.","Serum osteocalcin is elevated in Caucasian women with GDM throughout pregnancy, but was not predictive of the onset of GDM. Larger trials evaluating the role of osteocalcin and the development of GDM appear warranted.",closed_qa
Does hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin increase the aqueous solubility and stability of pilocarpine prodrugs?,"The effects of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) on the aqueous solubility and stability of two lipophilic bispilocarpine prodrugs were investigated at pH 7.4. The solubility of prodrugs was studied by phase-solubility method (0-72.5 mM HP-beta-CD). The stability of one of the prodrugs was investigated as a function of temperature (40 degrees C-70 degrees C) and HP-beta-CD concentration (0-72.5 mM). The apparent rate constants (k1, k2) for degradation of prodrug in 1:1 and 1:2 inclusion complexes and apparent stability constants (K1:1, K1:2) were calculated by the curve-fitting method. The phase-solubility diagrams were classified as Ap-type and the apparent stability constants (K1:1, K1:2) for 1:1- and 1:2-inclusion complexes were calculated to be 143-815 M-1 and 29-825 M-1, respectively. The stability of prodrug increased as a function of HP-beta-CD concentration over the studied temperature range. The shelf-life (t90%, calculated by the Arrhenius equation) of the prodrug in 72.5 mM HP-beta-CD solution increased 5.1-fold and 6.1-fold at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C, respectively.",The solubility of the prodrugs was shown to increase markedly in phase-solubility studies. The degradation rate of prodrug in stability studies was shown to be slower in the 1:2-complex than in the 1:1-complex and the relative amounts of complex species were found to be dependent on CD concentration.,closed_qa
Does phytoextract of Indian mustard seeds act by suppressing the generation of ROS against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells?,"Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. & Coss. (Brassicaceae)] is reported to possess diverse pharmacological properties. However, limited information is available concerning its hepatoprotective activity and mechanism of action. To study the protective mechanism of mustard seed extract against acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line. Hepatotoxicity models were established using APAP (2.5-22.5 mM) based on the cytotoxicity profile. An antioxidant-rich fraction from mustard seeds was extracted and evaluated for its hepatoprotective potential. The mechanism of action was elucidated using various in vitro antioxidant assays, the detection of intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell cycle analysis. The phytoconstituents isolated via HPLC-DAD were also evaluated for hepatoprotective activity. Hydromethanolic seed extract exhibited hepatoprotective activity in post- and pre-treatment models of 20 mM APAP toxicity and restored the elevated levels of liver indices to normal values (p < 0.05). Post-treatment suppressed the generation of ROS by 58.37% and pre-treatment effectively prevented the generation of ROS by 90.5%. The mechanism of ROS suppression was further supported by antioxidant activity (IC50) data from DPPH (103.37 ± 4.2 µg AAE/mg), FRAP (83.26 ± 1.1 µg AAE/mg), ORAC (1115 µM GAE/ml), ABTS (83.05 µg GAE/ml), and superoxide (345.22 ± 5.15 µg AAE/mg) scavenging assays and by the restoration of cell cycle alterations.

Endovascular therapy yields significantly superior outcomes for large vessel occlusions compared with intravenous thrombolysis: is it time to randomize?,"We compared outcomes between endovascular (EV) therapy and intravenous (IV) thrombolysis in large vessel strokes. 223 patients who had received either IV (n=100) or EV (n=123) therapy were analyzed. Only patients with strokes involving the internal carotid artery terminus (ICA-T, n=45), the middle cerebral artery (M1, n=107) or the bifurcation branches (M2, n=71) were included. The primary endpoint was 3 month outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, good-outcome defined as mRS ≤2. The good outcome was 44.7% in the EV group and 26% in the IV group (p=0.003, OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.1). There was no difference in mortality or hemorrhage. For ICA-T occlusions, the good outcome was 27.6% in the EV and 0% in the IV group (p=0.004); for M1 occlusions, 40.6% in the EV versus 10.5% in the IV group (p=0.0006, OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.9 to 18.2); and for M2 occlusions, 76% in the EV versus 47.8% in the IV group (p=0.01, OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 10.2). For M1 occlusions, the death rate was 27.5% for the EV compared with 57.9% for the IV group (p=0.002, OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.3) with no difference observed in mortality for ICA-T or M2 occlusions. In the univariate analysis, age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and occlusion site were significant predictors of outcome and mortality (p<0.0001 for all). In the multivariable analysis, EV therapy (p=0.0004, OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 9) and younger age (p<0.0001, OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.9 to 0.98) were significant independent predictors of good outcome.",There are significantly higher odds of a favorable outcome with EV compared with IV therapy for large vessel strokes.

Are topoisomerase mutations that associated with high-level resistance to earlier fluoroquinolones in Staphylococcus aureus have less effect on the antibacterial activity of besifloxacin?,"The impact of mutations in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was investigated to better understand why besifloxacin has a higher potency against Staphylococcus aureus when compared to other fluoroquinolones, which was especially pronounced against ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. MICs were determined for 52 clinical isolates against besifloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. The genes encoding GyrA, GyrB, ParC, and ParE were sequenced and the potential impact of mutations assessed in light of recent structural data. For all fluoroquinolones tested, the MICs increased with the number of mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions. However, this increase was the smallest for besifloxacin and the largest for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. In addition to the commonly observed mutations in ParC and GyrA, more unusual mutations in ParE, such as Asp-432→His or Pro-585→Ser, were also detected.","Compared to earlier fluoroquinolones, the higher potency of besifloxacin suggests that the drug's unique combination of a 7-azepinyl ring and an 8-chloro-substituent results in unique interactions with DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.",closed_qa
Does treatment of acute epistaxis secondary to guttural pouch mycosis with transarterial nitinol vascular occlusion plug in three equids?,"2 horses and 1 pony were evaluated for right-sided (1 horse and the pony) and left-sided (1 horse) acute epistaxis of 1 day's to 1 month's duration. Endoscopic examination of the 3 equids revealed that the hemorrhage originated from the right maxillary artery in 2 equids and from the left internal carotid artery in the third. Mycosis of the auditory tube diverticulum (guttural pouch) was detected in all 3 equids. All 3 equids underwent surgery, and transarterial nitinol intravascular plugs were placed to occlude affected blood vessels. All equids survived for a long period (ie, a minimum of 1 to 2 years) and returned to their previous use. All had complete regression of clinical signs of guttural pouch mycosis without additional medical treatment.","The use of transarterial nitinol intravascular plugs appeared to be an effective alternative to other techniques for the treatment of epistaxis secondary to guttural pouch mycosis, including transarterial occlusion devices such as embolization coils.",closed_qa
Is thyroid tubercle of zuckerkandl more consistently present and larger on the right : a prospective series?,"The tubercle of Zuckerkandl (TZ) is a lateral projection from the thyroid lobe in the vicinity of the extralaryngeal termination of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), which is a very useful landmark for identification of the RLN during thyroidectomy. The purpose of the present study was to test our hypothesis that the TZ is more consistently found and is larger on the right than on the left side, and to investigate the frequency of anatomic variations of the TZ. Prospective cohort study of 156 consecutive patients undergoing primary total thyroidectomy at an academic teaching hospital. Thyroidectomy was performed using a capsular dissection technique, with identification of the RLN only at its entry point into the larynx, using the TZ as a landmark. In vivo recording of size of right and left TZ was performed. The size of the right and left TZ was compared. Identification of the TZ was 72.6% right side and 53.9% left side (p = 0.003). The mean size of the TZ, when present, was 11.2 mm on the right and 7.5 mm on the left (p = 0.0002). In matched-pair analysis, the right TZ was significantly larger than the left TZ (p < 1 × 10(-7)). The TZ overlay the RLN in nearly all cases; however, there were 2 cases (0.8%) of a TZ extending medial to the RLN.

Are synaptophysin and the dopaminergic system in hippocampus involved in the protective effect of rutin against trimethyltin-induced learning and memory impairment?,"This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of rutin against trimethyltin-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in mice. This study focused on the role of synaptophysin, growth-associated protein 43 and the action of the dopaminergic system in mechanisms associated with rutin protection and trimethyltin-induced spatial learning and memory impairment. Cognitive learning and memory was measured by Morris Water Maze. The expression of synaptophysin and growth-associated protein 43 in hippocampus was analyzed by western blot. The concentrations of dopamine, homovanillic acid, and dihyroxyphenylacetic acid in hippocampus were detected using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Trimethyltin-induced spatial learning impairment showed a dose-dependent mode. Synaptophysin but not growth-associated protein 43 was decreased in the hippocampus after trimethyltin administration. The concentration of dopamine decreased, while homovanillic acid increased in the hippocampus after trimethyltin administration. Mice pretreated with 20 mg/kg of rutin for 7 consecutive days exhibited improved water maze performance. Moreover, rutin pretreatment reversed the decrease of synaptophysin expression and dopamine alteration.",These results suggest that rutin may protect against spatial memory impairment induced by trimethyltin. Synaptophysin and the dopaminergic system may be involved in trimethyltin-induced neuronal damage in hippocampus.,closed_qa
Does increasing body fat mass reverse bone loss in osteopenia as detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans?,"Low body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for osteoporosis and is part of the FRAX™ 10-year fracture risk stratification tool for predicting fragility fractures. Little is known regarding the effects of changing body composition on bone mineral density (BMD). However, increasing fat mass (FM) improves BMD in young women with anorexia nervosa. This study aimed to assess whether changes in FM over time affected BMD in the general population. Data was collected from patients who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) assessment between 2004 and 2011. Patients were included if they had multiple scans, including FM measurements. Our scanners limited these to scans of the lumbar spine. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between changes in FM and BMD. Backwards stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify confounding factors, including sex, risk factors, previous fractures, and baseline BMI. In this study, 23,239 patients were included, of which 702 met the inclusion criteria. There were 609 (86%) females and 93 (13%) males with a mean age of 64.5 (SD 11.2) years at first scan. We identified a strong positive correlation between increasing FM and BMD between scans (coefficient 28.4; p<0.01; 95% CI, 26.6-30.1). Previous pelvic and femur fractures and a history of inflammatory diseases were also associated with increasing FM (p<0.05). This relationship was true regardless of patients BMI at their first scan.",These findings suggest that patients at high risk of fragility fractures should be encouraged to increase their FM as long as they are at a low risk for disease states related to high FM.,closed_qa
Does tumor-derived tenascin-C promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer cells?,"Tenascin-C (TNC) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, usually derived from myofibroblasts in the cancer microenvironment. Recently, however, the significance of tumor-derived TNC in initiation of cancer metastasis was disclosed. We investigated the clinical significance of cancer-derived TNC in colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. TNC expression in 170 cases of CRC was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, gene expression arrays using purely-separated cancer tissues of another 86 cases was performed and the functional implications of cancer-specific TNC were investigated. The expression of TNC mRNA was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in the corresponding normal tissues. Cancer cell-specific TNC expression was a significant prognostic factor in CRC cases. Moreover, cancer cell-derived TNC was associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature.","Cancer cell-derived TNC promotes cancer invasiveness via EMT regulation, and not cancer tissue TNC but cancer cell-specific TNC is a novel indicator of poor prognosis.",closed_qa
Does two-dimensional sonographic cine imaging improve confidence in the initial evaluation of the fetal heart?,"Initial screening sonography of the fetal heart with static images is often inadequate, resulting in repeated imaging or failure to detect abnormalities. We hypothesized that the addition of short cine clips would reduce the need for repeated imaging. Two-dimensional (2D) static sonograms and short 2D cine clips of the 4-chamber view and left and right ventricular outflow tracts were obtained from 342 patients with gestational ages of greater than 16 weeks. A diagnostic radiologist and a perinatologist retrospectively reviewed the static and cine images independently and graded them as normal, abnormal, or suboptimal. A statistically significant increase in the number of structures called normal was seen when 2D cine clips were added to static imaging for both observers (P < .05); the radiologist called 86.5% normal with combined static and cine images versus 61.9% with static images alone, whereas the perinatologist recorded 68.1% as normal versus 58.8%, respectively. The radiologist called 77.8% of structures normal with cine images only versus 61.9% with static images only (P < .001), whereas the perinatologist called fewer structures normal with cine images alone (38.9%) versus static images alone (58.8%). The use of cine loops alone resulted in no significant increase in the ability to clear the heart as normal. The maternal body mass index was inversely associated with the ability to clear structures when 2D cine images were added to static images (P < .05).","The addition of 2D cine clips to standard 2D static imaging of the fetal heart significantly improves the number of structures cleared as normal.

Does adenovirus lacking the 19-kDa and 55-kDa E1B genes exert a marked cytotoxic effect in human malignant cells?,"The adenovirus (Ad) E1A gene exerts an antitumor effect and can induce sensitivity to treatment with DNA-damaging agents. In contrast, the Ad 19-kDa E1B protein inhibits E1A-mediated apoptosis and the 55-kDa E1B inactivates the p53 protein. In this paper, we study the in vitro and in vivo effects of a 19-kDa and 55-kDa E1B-defective Ad in several malignant human tumor cell lines. Nontumorigenic human fibroblasts (CCD-45SK and Hs67), peripheral blood lymphocytes, and several human tumor cell lines derived from cervix, colon, and breast carcinomas, epidermoid carcinoma, and osteosarcoma (HeLa, HT29, MCF7, Saos-2, and A431 cell lines) were studied. Wild-type (wt) Ad type 5 and H5 dL118 Ad, a mutant with the deleted E1B region, were employed. The cells were infected at 20 plaque-forming units, and cell viability was evaluated by the crystal violet method. In the in vivo experiments, 2 x 10(6) cells from the carcinoma cell lines HeLa, A431 and HT29 were injected into nude mice. The tumorigenicity of previously infected cells and after an intratumoral injection of Ad was analyzed. The mice received whole-body gamma-irradiation. The H5 dL118 mutant produced a marked cytopathic effect in all of the malignant cells, surpassing that of the wt Ad; viability at 72 hours ranged from 11% to 20% for H5 dL118 Ad and from 70% to 93% for the wt Ad with respect to uninfected controls. In the in vivo experiments, a total inhibition of tumorigenicity was detected when cells were infected prior to injection and a partial and transitory decrease in tumorigenicity was detected when the mutant H5 dL118 was injected intratumorally. gamma-irradiation enhanced the in vivo antitumor effects.","These results indicate that infection with completely E1B-deficient Ads induced a marked cytopathic effect on malignant cells that was higher than that seen for wt Ads; in addition, infection with such Ads exerts a tumor suppressor effect in vivo.",closed_qa
Nonparental care and infant health: do number of hours and number of concurrent arrangements matter?,"Previous research found that centre-based childcare is related to more illnesses early in life. The goal of this longitudinal study is to determine whether infant health in the first year of life is also related to the amount of time spent in non-parental care and the number of concurrent non-parental care arrangements. Information on infant health and non-parental care was obtained through monthly maternal interviews across the first year of life. The occurrences of respiratory, digestive, general, and skin illnesses and complaints were used as dependent variables, while the number of hours and the number of arrangements per week were used as predictors. Analyses were done separately in infants for whom centre-based childcare is included in their arrangements (n=107), and for those which it is not (n=61). Infants spending more hours in non-parental care had more respiratory and general illnesses. Infants who were cared for in more concurrent arrangements had fewer respiratory and general, but more skin illnesses. These results only applied to infants that included centre-based childcare in their arrangements. In the group of infants that did not attend centre-based childcare, health was not related to either the number of hours or the number of arrangements.","Number of hours and number of arrangements do matter in relation to infant health early in life, but only for infants who attend centre-based childcare.

Do growth factors improve the in vivo migration of human skeletal myoblasts by modulating their endogenous proteolytic activity?,"A main technological problem related to the clinical application of myoblast transplantation is the poor migration of transplanted cells. In this study, we investigated a new physiologic approach that consists of coinjecting motogenic factors insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to enhance the migration of human skeletal myoblasts. Among the different ways by which those factors can induce the cell migration processes, we investigated their capacity to enhance cell endogenous proteolytic activity that will help transplanted cells to migrate through the extracellular matrix. In vitro, myoblasts were coincubated with bFGF or IGF-1. Growth factors effects on cell migration were evaluated using invasion chambers, and their effects on proteolytic systems were evaluated by zymography, Western blot, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In vivo, myoblasts were coinjected with growth factors and the intramuscular migration capacity was assessed using the microtube technique. In vitro, the presence of IGF-1 or bFGF significantly enhanced the expression of the gelatinase matrix metalloproteinase-9 and focalized the fibrinolytic system activity at the cell membrane. In vitro and in vivo, both bFGF and IGF-1 showed strong chemokinetic potentials and improved the migration of human myoblasts. Moreover, the implication some proteinases in the in vivo enhanced migration was confirmed using specific inhibitors (BB94 or amiloride).",These results suggest that IGF-1 or bFGF coinjection with human myoblasts increased their proteolytic activities and consequently their migratory capacity. This study may help to develop approaches that will reduce the number of injection sites for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.,closed_qa
Are sex-specific asymmetries in communication sound perception related to hand preference in an early primate?,"Left hemispheric dominance of language processing and handedness, previously thought to be unique to humans, is currently under debate. To gain an insight into the origin of lateralization in primates, we have studied gray mouse lemurs, suggested to represent the most ancestral primate condition. We explored potential functional asymmetries on the behavioral level by applying a combined handedness and auditory perception task. For testing handedness, we used a forced food-grasping task. For testing auditory perception, we adapted the head turn paradigm, originally established for exploring hemispheric specializations in conspecific sound processing in Old World monkeys, and exposed 38 subjects to control sounds and conspecific communication sounds of positive and negative emotional valence. The tested mouse lemur population did not show an asymmetry in hand preference or in orientation towards conspecific communication sounds. However, males, but not females, exhibited a significant right ear-left hemisphere bias when exposed to conspecific communication sounds of negative emotional valence. Orientation asymmetries were not related to hand preference.","Our results provide the first evidence for sex-specific asymmetries for conspecific communication sound perception in non-human primates. Furthermore, they suggest that hemispheric dominance for communication sound processing evolved before handedness and independently from each other.",closed_qa
Are changes of serum beta-endorphin by programmed exercise training correlated with improvement of clinical symptoms and quality of life in female mitral valve prolapse syndrome?,"Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common entity in female population. Although this is a minor disease, it may cause annoying symptoms that impair quality of life (QOL), and no established therapy for this problem. The aim of this study isto examine whether programmed exercise training by treadmill in female MVP syndrome would improve clinical symptoms and QOL. An interventional study of 39 females with MVP syndrome with treadmill exercise endurance training for 12 weeks. Every individual received training for 30 min a day, thrice a week for 12 weeks. Baseline and post-exercise at 12 weeks serum beta-endorphins were measured. Symptom improvement was assessed by the MVP symptom checklist questionnaire and the Euro-QOL-5D was used to measure QOL improvement in these females. The mean serum beta-endorphin increased from 0.5 to 1.68 ng/ml (p = 0.001) in the exercise group (n = 18) after 12 weeks exercise, whereas the control group (n = 21) did not show any significant changes (0.44 vs. 0.43 ng/ml). Major symptoms of MVP such as chest pain, palpitation, fatigue were improved significantly by the assessment of MVP symptom checklist. The QOL of the exercised females also showed significant changes.","Through programmed exercise training in these MVP females, the improvement of symptoms and QOL is parallel to the increase of serum beta-endorphin. This result implicates that MVP females should initiate exercise to tackle this annoying problem.",closed_qa
Photodynamic diagnostics and noninvasive bladder cancer: is it cost-effective in long-term application?,"Noninvasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) causes an enormous economic burden to public health systems due to its life-long character and frequent recurrences. While white light (WL) cystoscopy is considered to be the gold standard for transurethral resection of the bladder, photodynamic diagnostic (PDD) has been shown to improve final outcome. Escalating healthcare costs warrant increased effectiveness in treating noninvasive UCB. No data based on assessment of costs have been published to date. A series of 301 patients with noninvasive UCB were randomized prospectively to standard WL or PDD transurethral resections of the bladder. Intravesical adjuvant therapy was administered as reflected in the appropriate guidelines. Expenditures of subsequent procedures and PDD-associated costs were assessed. Median follow-up was 7.1 yr. Disease recurrence was found in 42% and 18% of WL and PDD patients, respectively (p=0.0003). In the WL group 2.0 and in the PDD group 0.8 transurethral resections of the bladder were noted per patient. In the WL group 1.0 and in the PDD group 0.3 recurring UCB occurred per patient, resulting in costs of 1750 euro per WL patient versus 420 euro per PDD patient in the follow-up period, respectively. Because a single expenditure of 135 euro was assessed for PDD, overall costs were significantly lower (by 1195 euro) in PDD patients. As the median follow-up was 7.1 yr, costs saved by PDD per patient per year were 168 euro.",Our data suggest that PDD significantly cut costs related to recurring UCB. Further studies are needed from an economic point of view.,closed_qa
Do the contrast study of dermacyn on enterocoelia irrigate to control infection during the operation?,"To evaluate antimicrobial properties of Dermacyn in abdominal infections, and to develop a new method for peritoneal lavage without using antibiotics. 110 patients suffered from intestinal perforation (abdominal closed injury) who were treated with opened surgical repair or partial intestinal resection were enrolled in our test group. In the test group, Dermacyn was used for peritoneal lavage. During the same period, 102 patients with intestinal perforation of abdominal closed injury and opened repair or partial intestinal resection were enrolled in our control group. For the control group, we used Metronidazole physiological saline for peritoneal lavage. Patients in both groups had an indwelling peritoneal drainage tube postoperatively. Five objective indicators were studied and compared at 24 h/48 h/72 h time points. These indexes were: volume of drainage, drainage fluid culture, blood routine test, C-reactive protein, calcitonin and antibiotics dose. There were no significant differences between the drainage volumes in two groups three days after the operation. There were significant differences in the nature of the drainage fluid, bacterial culture results, blood routine, C-reaction protein and procalciton in two groups. In the experimental group, after the Dermacyn flushing, the average volume of peritoneal drainage fluid was reduced (from 30 ml to 5 ml) from 24 to 72 hours postoperatively.","Use of Dermacyn, with its broad spectrum bactericidal effect, as the nonantibiotic ingredient for intraoperative peritoneal lavage was effective in bringing down the risk of infection. Dermacyn could be used safely to perform peritoneal flushing to clean the operation site.",closed_qa
Do temporal stability of the timeline followback interview for alcohol and drug use with psychiatric outpatients?,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of the Timeline Followback (TLFB) interview for assessing daily alcohol and drug use with adults living with a severe mental illness. Participants were 132 psychiatric outpatients (64% men) with a confirmed schizophrenia-spectrum (52%) or major mood disorder (48%) and a lifetime history of substance use disorder. They completed a 90-day TLFB twice, separated by a mean of 5 days, and represented 55% of the participants who originally consented to be in the study. Test-retest reliability coefficients ranged from 0.73 to 1.00 (rounded) for 30-day TLFB and from 0.77 to 1.00 (rounded) for the 90-day TLFB. Within-subject comparisons of means across the three 30-day windows revealed no significant differences, and no degradation of the magnitude of the reliability coefficients was observed with increasingly distant assessment periods.",The TLFB is a reliable method of assessing alcohol and drug use in outpatients diagnosed with severe mental illness.,closed_qa
Is eGFR R497K polymorphism a favorable prognostic factor for advanced lung cancer?,"It has been reported that the R497K polymorphism of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene has attenuated functions in ligand binding, tyrosine kinase activation, and growth stimulation. On other hand, EGFR gene mutations at kinase domain in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib. We investigated the EGFR mutations and/or R497K polymorphism statuses in 225 surgically treated NSCLC cases. 192 adenocarcinoma cases were included. The presence or absence of EGFR polymorphism of exon 13 was analyzed by PCR-RFLP method. EGFR mutations at kinase domain were found from 95 of 225 lung cancer patients. In 86.2% of patients, homo- or heterozygous Lys497 allele was present. No correlation existed between R497K EGFR genotype and clinico-pathological features, such as gender, smoking status, and pathological subtypes.","EGFR mutation status was not correlated with R497KEGFR genotype of lung cancers. In node-negative patients, R497KEGFR genotype was not correlated with disease outcome. In node-positive patients, however, R497K EGFR was significantly associated with better overall survival. This association was attributable to neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. In 46 total gefitinib treated NSCLC patients, the prognosis was not different between the EGFR wild type (GG) patients and AG+AA patients. R497KEGFR polymorphism might be associated with favorable prognosis of advanced lung cancers and correlated with chemosensitivity.",closed_qa
Does osmotic-shock produced by vitrification solutions improve immature human oocytes in vitro maturation?,"During cytoplasmic oocyte maturation, Ca(2+) currents are vital for regulating a broad range of physiological processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that DMSO and EG cause large transient increases in intracellular Ca(2+) in mouse oocytes. The CP used in vitrifying protocols also increases the intracellular calcium transient. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of vitrifying time (before and after IVM) and exposure to the vitrification solutions and ionomycin on oocyte quality and embryonic development. 221 GV-oocytes unsuitable for IVF-ICSI cycles were randomly distributed into one of the following three groups. G1 (control group): 41 GV-oocytes IVM until MII; G2: 43 oocytes vitrified at GV stage and IVM until MII stage; and G3: 53 GV-oocytes IVM until MII and then vitrified. In order to clarify the effect of vitrification solutions (VS) on human oocyte IVM through the intracellular Ca(2+) oscillation, the following two groups were also included. G4: 43 GV-oocytes exposed to VS and IVM until MII; and G5: 41 GV-oocytes exposed to ionomycin and IVM until MII. All GV-oocytes that reached MII-stage were parthenogenetically activated to assess oocyte viability. IVM was performed in IVF-medium (24-48 h). Chemical treatment (ionomycin) and osmotic treatment (vitrification solutions) were performed without liquid-N2 immersion. The following rates were evaluated: survival (SR), in-vitro maturation (IVMR), activation (AR), development to 2-cell (DRC), development to morula (DRCM) and development to blastocyst (DRB). Ratios between the different treatment groups were compared using contingency tables analysis (chi-square test). A high survival rate was obtained in G2 (95.5 %) and G4 (96.6 %). In-vitro maturation rate was significantly higher for G4 (86 %) and G2 (83.7 %) compared to G1 (63.4 %), G3 (56.6 %) and G5 (48.8 %). DRCM was significantly higher for G1 and G2 compared to G3 (G1: 15.8 %, G2: 20.7 % and G3: 0 %). DRB was only obtained for the oocytes vitrified before IVM (G2: 3.4 %). AR was also significantly higher for G2 and G4 compared to G5 (G2: 80.5 %, G4: 86.5 % and G5: 55 %). DRCM and DRB were only obtained in G2 and G4. DRCM was significantly higher for oocytes vitrified at GV stage (G2) and for oocytes exposed to the VS in G4 compared to the oocytes exposed to the ionomycin in G5 (G2: 20.7 %; G4: 37.5 % and G5: 0 %).",Vitrifying GV-oocytes improves their IVM. Further investigation could look to increase the oocyte pool and improve fertility preservation options.,closed_qa
Is cell proliferation in in vivo-like three-dimensional cell culture regulated by sequestration of ERK1/2 to lipid rafts?,"Regulatory mechanisms of cell proliferation have been extensively studied as they represent major challenges when dealing with pathologies such as fibrosis, tumourigenesis or tissue regeneration. Numerous in vitro studies still exploit conventional, two-dimensional cell cultures where cells are forced to adhere to unnaturally stiff and flat surfaces of culture dishes. In the living organism, however, each cell is in contact with components of the extracellular matrix and/or neighbouring cells, thus creating a complex three-dimensional (3D) tissue structure. The current paper describes a native 3D culture of cells, based on the GD25β1 fibroblast cell line, and its use for investigating cell proliferation in in vivo-like conditions. Four-day post-confluent culture of GD25β1 fibroblasts resulted in formation of a 3D system of cells embedded in naturally synthesized extracellular matrix. Morphological characterization of the culture was performed by histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Viability/proliferation was assayed by MTT testing, FACS analysis and Western blotting for determination of expression levels and activation status of the relevant signalling molecules. GD25b1 fibroblasts, grown as 3D culture, gave rise to tissue-like structures characterized by low level of apoptosis, low senescence and development of 3D matrix adhesions, typical of living tissues. Transition to three-dimensionality led to a switch from exponential to linear culture growth, accompanied by accumulation of activated ERK1/2 into caveolin-containing raft domains. Disruption of raft domains as well as reverse transition from 3D back to monolayer culture led to release of phosphorylated ERK1/2 from rafts, activation of cyclin D1 expression and increase in proliferation levels.","These results imply that under in vivo-like conditions, cells might achieve reduction of their proliferation level by sequestering activated ERK1/2 to lipid rafts.",closed_qa
Does voluntary running exercise attenuate the progression of endothelial dysfunction and arterial calcification in ovariectomized rats?,"Loss of oestrogen synthesis capacity after menopause contributes to increases in arterial stiffness and calcification. Exercise training improves arterial stiffness and calcification. However, the mechanism of exercise training-induced improvement of arterial stiffness and calcification remains unclear. We examined the mechanism by using aortas of sham-operated rats (sham control; SC), ovariectomized rats (OVX control; OC), OVX plus treatment with vitamin D(3) plus nicotine (VDN) rats (OV sedentary; OVSe), which is an animal model of endothelial dysfunction and arterial calcification, and voluntary running wheel exercise for 8 weeks plus OVX plus VDN rats (OV exercise; OVEx). The arterial tissue calcium and endothelin-1 (ET-1: a vasoconstrictor peptide and a potent regulator of arterial calcification) levels were significantly higher in OVSe rats compared with the SC and OC rats, whereas these levels in the OVEx rats were significantly lower than in the OVSe rats. Additionally, arterial expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is an enzyme that produces nitric oxide (NO: a vasodilator substance), was reduced in OVSe rats. However, exercise training prevented the decrease in eNOS expression. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between arterial calcium level and arterial ET-1 level.","These findings suggest that exercise training-induced improvement of ET-1 and NO prevents the impairment of endothelial function after menopause in females, and this improvement may result in less arterial calcification.",closed_qa
"Are reduced glenohumeral rotation , external rotation weakness and scapular dyskinesis risk factors for shoulder injuries among elite male handball players : a prospective cohort study?","To determine whether rotator cuff strength, glenohumeral joint range of motion and scapular control are associated with shoulder injuries among elite male handball players. A total of 206 players in the Norwegian elite handball league for men were tested prior to the 2011-2012 season. Measures included: (1) glenohumeral internal and external rotation range of motion, (2) isometric internal rotation, external rotation and abduction strength and (3) assessment of scapular dyskinesis. Players were followed prospectively for the entire regular season (30 weeks), with shoulder problems registered bi-weekly using the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire. A cumulative severity score was calculated for each player based on their questionnaire responses. This was used as the outcome measure in risk factor analyses. The average prevalence of shoulder problems throughout the season was 28% (95% CI 25% to 31%). The prevalence of substantial shoulder problems, defined as those leading to moderate or severe reductions in handball participation or performance, or to time loss, was 12% (95% CI 11% to 13%). Significant associations were found between obvious scapular dyskinesis (OR 8.41, 95% CI 1.47 to 48.1, p<0.05), total rotational motion (OR 0.77 per 5° change, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.995, p<0.05) and external rotation strength (OR 0.71 per 10 Nm change, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.99, p<0.05) and shoulder injury.","Injury prevention programmes should incorporate interventions aimed at improving glenohumeral rotational range of motion, external rotation strength and scapular control.",closed_qa
Does multiparametric MRI correlate of sensorimotor function in the spinal cord in multiple sclerosis?,"Spinal cord (SC) pathology is a major contributor to clinical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically SC-MRI lesion load measures that include lesion count and volume, demonstrate only a modest relationship with the clinical status of MS patients. Although SC cross-sectional area (CSA) correlates better with clinical dysfunction than MRI lesion count, SC atrophy likely signifies irreversible tissue loss. Using quantitative MRI indices sensitive to early and late microstructural changes in the spinal cord, we searched for the presence of better correlations between MRI measures and clinical status in MS. We investigated whether diffusion-tensor imaging indices and the magnetization-transfer ratio (MTR) were better associated with the clinical status of MS patients than conventional SC-MRI measures. A total of 129 MS patients underwent 3-tesla cervical SC-MRI and quantitative sensorimotor function testing, using the Vibratron-II and dynamometer. Regions-of-interest circumscribed the SC on axial slices between C3-C4. We calculated SC-CSA, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), perpendicular diffusivity (λ perpendicular), parallel diffusivity (λ||) and MTR. We used multivariable linear regression to determine if there were any associations between MRI indices and clinical measures of dysfunction. All MRI indices were significantly different in subjects with MS versus healthy controls, and between the progressive versus relapsing MS subtypes, with the exception of λ||. In multivariable regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, brain parenchymal fraction, and SC-CSA, the MRI indices independently explained variability in hip flexion strength (p-values: MD, λ perpendicular, λ|| < 0.001; FA = 0.07), vibration sensation threshold (p-values: FA = 0.04; MTR = 0.05; λ perpendicular = 0.06), and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (p-values: FA = 0.003; MD = 0.03; λ perpendicular = 0.005; MTR = 0.02).","In a large, heterogeneous MS sample, quantitative SC-MRI indices demonstrated independent associations with system-specific and global clinical dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the indices studied may provide important information about microstructural SC changes and the substrates of limb disability in MS. The identified structure-function relationships underpin the potential utility of these measures in assessments of therapeutic efficacy.",closed_qa
Does progesterone induce apoptosis and up-regulation of p53 expression in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines?,"Progesterone (PROG) has been shown to reduce the risk of developing ovarian carcinoma in postmenopausal women who have undergone estrogen and progestogen replacement therapy, and it has been clinically used to treat some types of ovarian tumors. It is not yet clear whether or not the antitumor activity of progestogen is due to its ability to induce apoptosis in precarcinomatous and carcinomatous ovarian cells. The apoptosis-related genes p53, bcl-2, and c-myc have important roles in the regulation of programmed cell death, and thus may be involved in the process of the suspected PROG-induced apoptosis. Antiproliferation effects of PROG on 3AO and AO ovarian carcinoma cells were determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Apoptosis of the PROG-treated cells was determined by DNA laddering analysis and was quantitated by both nuclear condensation and flow cytometry after cells were stained with propidium iodide. Cell cycle analysis was also performed by flow cytometry. The expression of p53, bcl-2, and c-myc after 72 hours of PROG treatment was detected by Northern blot analysis. In both 3AO and AO cell lines, cells proliferation was maximally inhibited by PROG after 72 hours of treatment at 10 microM concentration. Under the same conditions, more than 50% of PROG-treated cells had undergone apoptosis, whereas less than 3% of the cells were apoptotic in untreated cell cultures. After exposure to PROG for 72 hours, cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and the levels of p53 mRNA were remarkably increased in both cell lines. No changes in expression of bcl-2 or c-myc were detected.","PROG significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both of the ovarian carcinoma cell lines tested in this study. PROG treatment markedly up-regulated p53 expression in these cells, indicating involvement of p53 in PROG-induced apoptosis.",closed_qa
Does systemic administration of phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone protect the retina from light damage?,"This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), a spin-trapping agent known to cross the blood-brain barrier and protect the brain from ischemia-reperfusion injury, is incorporated into the retina after intraperitoneal injection and protects photoreceptor cells from the damaging effects of constant visible light. Albino rats were injected intraperitoneally with PBN (aqueous solution) or water, or were not injected, and then were placed in constant light (2700 lux) for 24 hours. The incorporation of PBN into the retina was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded before light treatment and 1 and 15 days after the cessation of exposure to constant light. Eyes were taken for histology at each time point and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness determined. PBN was incorporated into the retina after intraperitoneal injection. Both control (water-injected and uninjected) groups exposed to constant light maintained only 28% of ONL thickness and 20% of retinal function, compared with the unexposed control group. In contrast, the PBN-treated animals maintained 80% of ONL thickness and exhibited 87% of retinal function.",PBN protects the albino rat retina from the damaging effects of constant light stress. That light-induced and hereditary retinal degenerations share certain morphologic hallmarks and follow a similar apoptotic mechanism of degeneration raises the possibility of pharmacologic therapy for hereditary and environmentally induced neurodegenerative disorders.,closed_qa
Do α6β1- and αV-integrins are required for long-term self-renewal of murine embryonic stem cells in the absence of LIF?,"The growth properties and self-renewal capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells are regulated by their immediate microenvironment such as the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins, a central family of cellular ECM receptors, have been implicated in these processes but their specific role in ES cell self-renewal remains unclear. Here we have studied the effects of different ECM substrates and integrins in mouse ES cells in the absence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) using short-term assays as well as long-term cultures. Removal of LIF from ES cell culture medium induced morphological differentiation of ES cells into polarized epistem cell-like cells. These cells maintained epithelial morphology and expression of key stemness markers for at least 10 passages in the absence of LIF when cultured on laminin, fibronectin or collagen IV substrates. The specific functional roles of α6-, αV- and β1-integrin subunits were dissected using stable lentivirus-mediated RNAi methodology. β1-integrins were required for ES cell survival in long-term cultures and for the maintenance of stem cell marker expression. Inhibition of α6-integrin expression compromised self-renewal on collagen while αV-integrins were required for robust ES cell adhesion on laminin. Analysis of the stemness marker expression revealed subtle differences between α6- and αV-depleted ES cells but the expression of both was required for optimal self-renewal in long-term ES cell cultures.","In the absence of LIF, long-term ES cell cultures adapt an epistem cell-like epithelial phenotype and retain the expression of multiple stem cell markers. Long-term maintenance of such self-renewing cultures depends on the expression of β1-, α6- and αV-integrins.",closed_qa
Is There a Benefit to Prolonging the Interval Between Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation and Esophagectomy in Esophageal Cancer?,"Evidence suggests that delaying surgical procedures may increase the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) and that pCR is associated with improved overall survival (OS). In this study, the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was analyzed to evaluate this relationship in a large hospital-based registry. We identified patients diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) followed by esophagectomy from 2003 to 2012. Patients were stratified into quartiles based on the interval between the completion of CRT to operative treatment (≤40 days, 41-50 days, 51-63 days, and ≥64 days), and those with pT0N0M0 were classified as having pCR. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the impact of covariates on pCR, and multivariate Cox regression was used to assess their impact on OS. The study population included 5,393 patients. Increasing the time interval to the surgical procedure was associated with an increased pCR rate (12.3% for ≤40 days to 18.3% for ≥64 days; p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, a time interval greater than or equal to 51 days was associated with an increased likelihood of pCR (p = 0.009 for 51-63 days; p<0.001 for ≥64 days), as was an increased radiation dose ≥50 Gy (p = 0.046 for 50-50.4 Gy; p = 0.02 for>50.4 Gy). Increasing the time interval was not associated with an improvement in OS for any quartile on multivariate analysis. In addition, OS was worse for those who underwent operation ≥64 days after completion of radiation therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.33; p = 0.03).","Although increasing the time interval from CRT to surgical intervention was associated with a higher pCR rate, there was no improvement in survival.",closed_qa
Are sleep and life quality of family caregivers affected as much as those of hemodialysis patients?,"The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the quality of sleep, quality of life, and anxiety and depression symptoms reported by hemodialysis (HD) patients and family caregivers of HD patients. The study included 142 pairs of HD patients and their caregivers. To assess quality of sleep, quality of life, and anxiety and depressive symptoms, the 36-item Short Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively, were used. For the patients, 73.9% were poor sleepers. Low Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores were found in 89.1% and 76.3% of HD patients, respectively. For the caregivers, 88% were poor sleepers. Low PCS and MCS scores were found in 62% and 70.4% of the caregivers, respectively. Mean PSQI scores, subjective sleep quality scores, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction scores of the caregivers were significantly higher than the scores of the HD patients (P<.001).","Caregivers of dialysis patients experience adverse effects on their quality of sleep and quality of life.

Is paediatric intensive care feasible in a neonatal department?,"Intensive care of infants below one year of age has been centralized in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) related to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Rigshospitalet, the University Hospital in Copenhagen in eastern Denmark (approximately 2.5 million inhabitants) since 2002. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the experiences from the PICU. A descriptive study including data from the 01.01.2002-31.12.2010-period from all the admissions to the PICU for infants below one year of age fulfilling one of two criteria: 1) born preterm and admitted to the department after 40 weeks of gestational age or 2) born at term and admitted to the department at an age -older than 28 days. Data were registered prospectively including information on primary diagnoses at admission, the need for mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Mortality was evaluated in the three year-period 2008-2010 by use of the Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 score (PIM2 score). The nine-year period saw 927 admissions to the PICU and 355 infants received mechanical ventilation (median three days). The PIM2 score was 6.7% and the mortality was 6.7% in the period during which PIM2 score was registered. The incidence of mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure was 0.74/1,000 infants born in the -region.",The experience from the NICU seems to -compensate for a low volume of infants in the PICU.

Does helicobacter pylori infection activate NF-kappa B in gastric epithelial cells?,"Helicobacter pylori adheres to gastric epithelial cells and stimulates interleukin (IL)-8 production. This may be instrumental in neutrophil infiltration of the gastric epithelium that characterizes H. pylori gastritis. This study examined the molecular mechanisms leading to H. pylori-induced epithelial cell IL-8 production. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses for NF-kappa B were performed on cell and nuclear extracts from H. pylori-infected AGS and Kato III human gastric epithelial cells. H. pylori infection activated the transcription factor NF-kappa B and induced nuclear translocation of both NF-kappa B p50/p65 heterodimers and p50 homodimers. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B (30 minutes) was followed by increased IL-8 messenger RNA (1 hour) and protein levels (4 hours) consistent with NF-kappa B up-regulation of IL-8 gene transcription. Pretreatment of AGS cells with PDTC, which blocks NF-kappa B activation, inhibited H. pylori-induced increases in IL-8 production by 90%. Immunohistochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the I-kappa B binding region of p65 showed activated NF-kappa B in gastric epithelial cells of patients with H. pylori gastritis.","H. pylori infection activates NF-kappa B in gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. NF-kappa B is a transcriptional regulator of IL-8 production, and its activation after bacterial infection may be an important defense response in gastrointestinal epithelial cells.",closed_qa
Do dystrophin-deficient dogs with reduced myostatin have unequal muscle growth and greater joint contractures?,"Myostatin (Mstn) is a negative regulator of muscle growth whose inhibition promotes muscle growth and regeneration. Dystrophin-deficient mdx mice in which myostatin is knocked out or inhibited postnatally have a less severe phenotype with greater total mass and strength and less fibrosis and fatty replacement of muscles than mdx mice with wild-type myostatin expression. Dogs with golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) have previously been noted to have increased muscle mass and reduced fibrosis after systemic postnatal myostatin inhibition. Based partly on these results, myostatin inhibitors are in development for use in human muscular dystrophies. However, persisting concerns regarding the effects of long-term and profound myostatin inhibition will not be easily or imminently answered in clinical trials. To address these concerns, we developed a canine (GRippet) model by crossbreeding dystrophin-deficient GRMD dogs with Mstn-heterozygous (Mstn (+/-)) whippets. A total of four GRippets (dystrophic and Mstn (+/-)), three GRMD (dystrophic and Mstn wild-type) dogs, and three non-dystrophic controls from two litters were evaluated. Myostatin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels were downregulated in both GRMD and GRippet dogs. GRippets had more severe postural changes and larger (more restricted) maximal joint flexion angles, apparently due to further exaggeration of disproportionate effects on muscle size. Flexors such as the cranial sartorius were more hypertrophied on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the GRippets, while extensors, including the quadriceps femoris, underwent greater atrophy. Myostatin protein levels negatively correlated with relative cranial sartorius muscle cross-sectional area on MRI, supporting a role in disproportionate muscle size. Activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB) expression was higher in dystrophic versus control dogs, consistent with physiologic feedback between myostatin and ActRIIB. However, there was no differential expression between GRMD and GRippet dogs. Satellite cell exhaustion was not observed in GRippets up to 3 years of age.","Partial myostatin loss may exaggerate selective muscle hypertrophy or atrophy/hypoplasia in GRMD dogs and worsen contractures. While muscle imbalance is not a feature of myostatin inhibition in mdx mice, findings in a larger animal model could translate to human experience with myostatin inhibitors.",closed_qa
Initial review of Electronic Residency Application Service charts by orthopaedic residency faculty members. Does applicant gender matter?,"Orthopaedic surgery is a male-dominated field. As of 1998, women accounted for 42% of medical school graduates, yet only 6.9% of the total number of orthopaedic residents were female. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the Electronic Residency Application Service charts of female candidates for orthopaedic residencies are ranked lower by faculty reviewers than are those of male candidates with similar qualifications. After we obtained permission from the applicants, the Electronic Residency Application Service applications submitted by ninety male and ten female candidates for admission to a university orthopaedic residency program for the 1998 National Residency Matching Program were randomly divided into ten groups, consisting of the charts of nine male candidates and one female candidate. Each chart from a female candidate was altered into a ""male"" version, in which all names and personal pronouns were changed but which was otherwise identical to the original female version. Therefore, each group of ten charts existed as a paired set: one containing the true female chart and one, the altered ""male"" chart. The paired sets acted as their own control. One hundred and twenty-one faculty reviewers from fourteen orthopaedic residency programs around the United States each reviewed either the ""male"" or the female version of one set, without knowledge of the goals of the study, and ranked the ten charts in the order in which they would like to have the candidates as residents in their own programs. Each version of the sets was reviewed by at least five separate reviewers. Reviewers at a given institution were randomized to review different sets, so that there was no overlap among them. The rankings of the female-""male"" pairs were compared with use of a standard paired t test. No significant difference was detected in the rankings of the female and ""male"" charts (p = 0.5). The mean difference in rankings was -0.33, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -1.41 (favoring females) to 0.74 (favoring ""males"").","The low percentage of female residents is not due to bias against female applicants in the initial chart-review phase of the orthopaedic residency selection process. It is possible that bias is introduced in other stages of the selection process, such as the interview.",closed_qa
A sociomedical geriatric assessment in the emergency units: an alternative to the hospitalization of aged patients?,"Elderly patients admitted to the emergency unit are usually hospitalized in medical units. Could a gerontologic evaluation in the emergency room lead to another solution than hospitalization? Since January 1993, a sociomedical geriatric reception has been operating in the emergency unit of the university hospital in Brest, France, every day from 10 AM. to 6 PM. Patients older than 75 years, dependent or at risk of dependence are examined by a geriatrician. The medical situation is evaluated. The nutrition status, the cognitive functions, the thymic functions, the gait, and the functional abilities are systematically studied. In the same time the social evaluation is realised by a social worker. From January 1993 to December 1996, 1,514 patients have been cared for by the social medical team. Once the assessment of each patient was made only 49% of them actually had to be hospitalized in a medical department. The outcome of 100 patients discharged between January 1994 and June 1994 was evaluated one year after their discharge at home, 11 patients were rehospitalized.

Are the expression of efflux and uptake transporters regulated by statins in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells?,"Statin disposition and response are greatly determined by the activities of drug metabolizing enzymes and efflux/ uptake transporters. There is little information on the regulation of these proteins in human cells after statin therapy. In this study, the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin on mRNA expression of efflux (ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCC2) and uptake (SLCO1B1, SLCO2B1 and SLC22A1) drug transporters in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells were investigated. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels after exposure of HepG2 and Caco-2 cells to statins. Differences in mRNA basal levels of the transporters were as follows: ABCC2>ABCG2>ABCB1>SLCO1B1>>>SLC22A1>SLC O2B1 for HepG2 cells, and SLCO2B1>>ABCC2>ABCB1>ABCG2>>>SLC22A1 for Caco-2 cells. While for HepG2 cells, ABCC2, ABCG2 and SLCO2B1 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated at 1, 10 and 20 micromol/L after 12 or 24 h treatment, in Caco-2 cells, only the efflux transporter ABCB1 was significantly down-regulated by two-fold following a 12 h treatment with atorvastatin. Interestingly, whereas treatment with simvastatin had no effect on mRNA levels of the transporters in HepG2 cells, in Caco-2 cells the statin significantly down-regulated ABCB1, ABCC2, SLC22A1, and SLCO2B1 mRNA levels after 12 or 24 h treatment.","These findings reveal that statins exhibits differential effects on mRNA expression of drug transporters, and this effect depends on the cell type. Furthermore, alterations in the expression levels of drug transporters in the liver and/or intestine may contribute to the variability in oral disposition of statins.Acta Pharmacologica Sinica (2009) 30: 956-964; doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.85; published online 22 June 2009.",closed_qa
Does percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) with T-fasteners obviate the need for emergent replacement after early tube dislodgement?,"Despite technical refinements of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, complications such as early tube dislodgement remain relatively static. This study aimed to review the experience of a high-volume endoscopy center after the introduction of T-fastener placement in high-risk patients. The authors retrospectively reviewed PEG placement from October 2010 to September 2011, when their group began to use T-fasteners selectively in high-risk patients. Patients deemed to have an increased risk for early tube dislodgement underwent T-fastener placement at the time of PEG placement. Patients with PEG alone were compared with patients who had PEG with T-fastener (PEG-T) placement. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18. During the study period, 195 patients underwent PEG placement. For 121 patients, PEG alone was performed, whereas PEG-T was performed for 74 patients. Six patients had tube dislodgement (five early, one late) in the PEG-T cohort versus none in the PEG-alone cohort (P = 0.003). The first patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with replacement gastrostomy 2 days after tube dislodgement and was noted to have no contamination, with direct apposition of the stomach to the abdominal wall from the T-fasteners. The subsequent four patients with early tube dislodgement underwent non-emergent PEG replacement in the endoscopy unit within 24 h after tube dislodgement. In the short-term follow-up period, no repeat dislodgements were noted. Early mortality in the entire cohort was experienced by 38 (19.5%) of the 195 patients.",Placement of T-fasteners in high-risk patients may decrease overall morbidity if early tube dislodgement occurs. The findings show the safety of non-emergent endoscopic replacement of PEGs in certain patients. Early tube dislodgement may be a marker of overall mortality.,closed_qa
Does cross-hemispheric Alternating Current Stimulation During a Nap disrupt Slow Wave Activity and Associated Memory Consolidation?,"Slow Wave Activity (SWA), the low frequency (<4 Hz) oscillations that characterize Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) are thought to relate causally to declarative memory consolidation during nocturnal sleep. Evidence is conflicting relating SWA to memory consolidation during nap however. We applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) - which, with a cross-hemispheric electrode montage (F3 and F4 - International 10:20 EEG system), is able to disrupt brain oscillations-to determine if disruption of low frequency oscillation generation during afternoon nap is causally related to disruption in declarative memory consolidation. Eight human subjects each participated in stimulation and sham nap sessions. A verbal paired associate learning (PAL) task measured memory changes. During each nap period, five 5-min stimulation (0.75 Hz cross-hemispheric frontal tACS) or sham intervals were applied with 1-min post-stimulation intervals (PSI's). Spectral EEG power for Slow (0.7-0.8 Hz), Delta (1.0-4.0 Hz), Theta (4.0-8.0 Hz), Alpha (8.0-12.0 Hz), and Spindle-range (12.0-14.0) frequencies was analyzed during the 1-min preceding the onset of stimulation and the 1-min PSI's. As hypothesized, power reduction due to stimulation positively correlated with reduction in word-pair recall post-nap specifically for Slow (P < 0.0022) and Delta (P < 0.037) frequency bands.",These results provide preliminary evidence suggesting a causal and specific role of SWA in declarative memory consolidation during nap.,closed_qa
Coronary artery ectasia and inflammatory cytokines: link with a predominant Th-2 immune response?,"The role of inflammation in coronary artery ectasia (CAE) remains controversial. We evaluated the hypothesis that CAE might be associated with a specific pattern of T helper (Th) lymphocyte activation by measuring the Th-1 cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the Th-2 cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with CAE, obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and controls. Serum levels of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 were measured in 74 patients undergoing an elective cardiac catheterization due to angina pectoris and positive or equivocal non-invasive screening for cardiac ischaemia: 34 had CAE and non-obstructive CAD (Group A), 22 had obstructive CAD (Group B) and 18 had normal coronaries (Group C). Group A had significantly higher IL-4 than Group B and Group C (p<0.001 and p=0.006, respectively). In contrast, Group A had markedly lower IL-2 than Group B and Group C (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Group C had higher IL-4 and lower IL-2 than Group B (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Interleukin-6 was significantly higher in Groups A and B compared to Group C (p<0.001 for both comparisons), whilst it was comparable between Group A and Group B. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher levels of IL-4 and lower levels of IL-2 were the strongest independent predictors associated with CAE (OR: 3.846, CI: 1.677-8.822, p=0.001 and OR: 0.567, CI: 0.387-0.831, p=0.004, respectively).","Our data demonstrates that Th-2 immune response, exhibited through increased IL-4 and low IL-2, constitutes a fundamental feature of CAE.",closed_qa
Anticoagulation for critically ill cardiac surgery patients: is primary bivalirudin the next step?,"Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in critically ill cardiac surgery patients has several limitations, including the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The use of a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin, might either treat this complication or completely eliminate it. The aim of the present study was to analyze the use of bivalirudin in this setting, as either a secondary drug switching from heparin or as the primary anticoagulant, and to evaluate clinical outcomes. Propensity-matching retrospective analysis. A cardiac surgery intensive care unit. One hundred propensity-matched patients who received heparin or bivalirudin. Bivalirudin was administered as a first-line or second-line drug after heparin discontinuation in case of thrombocytopenia and suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Twenty-six patients (52%) received bivalirudin as a primary anticoagulant, while 24 patients (48%) received bivalirudin after switching from heparin. Bivalirudin treatment was associated with a reduction of major bleeding (p=0.05) compared with the control group. Interestingly, in an intention-to-treat analysis, patients receiving primary bivalirudin showed significant reductions in minor bleeding (p=0.04), and mortality (p=0.01) compared with the secondary bivalirudin group and, similarly, compared with the rest of the study population (UFH and secondary bivalirudin patients, p=0.01 and p=0.05, respectively). Predictors of hospital mortality by multivariate analysis included urgent admission (odds ratio [OR]=2.7; 95 confidence interval [CI], 1.03-7.2; p=0.04), ;septic shock (OR=8.0; 95 CI, 2.26-28.7; p<0.005) and primary therapy with UFH (OR=19.2; 95 CI, 2.2-163.9; p=0.007).","Novel anticoagulant strategies might play a crucial role in critically ill cardiac surgery patients. In a propensity-matched population, results of the present study showed that primary bivalirudin anticoagulation may reduce bleeding complications and mortality.",closed_qa
Is the activation of the NF-κB-JNK pathway independent of the PI3K-Rac1-JNK pathway involved in the bFGF-regulated human fibroblast cell migration?,"Skin wound healing is a complex process that repairs multiple organ-tissues. Fibroblasts are key players of skin cells, whose migration is important during wound healing process. bFGF has shown a great efficacy to promote cell migration, but the precise mechanism by which bFGF regulates cell migration remains elusive. The aim of this study was to find bFGF-regulated gene pools and further identify target molecules that participated in human fibroblast cell migration. Skin primary fibroblasts and rat skin wound model were used to demonstrate the novel mechanism of bFGF regulating cell migration to accelerate wound healing. Cell migration was determined using the wound healing scratch assay. The differentially expressed genes and numerous biochemical pathways after bFGF treatment were identified by RNA-Seq analysis, and differentially expressed genes were further verified by qRT-PCR. siRNA duplex target to interfering the expression of PI3-kinase (p110α) was transformed into NIH/3T3 cells. Western blotting analysis was used to determine marker protein expressions. The invasive activity of fibroblasts was measured using 3D spheroid cell invasion assay. RNA-Seq analysis identified numerous biochemical pathways including the NF-κB pathway under the control of FGF signaling. bFGF negatively regulates the phosphorylation of IκB-α, the most well studied NF-κB signaling regulator while bFGF induces JNK phosphorylation. Application of Bay11-7082, a representative NF-κB inhibitor promoted cell migration, invasion and enhanced the JNKs phosphorylation. However, inhibition of JNKs blocked cell migration when NF-κB is inhibited. Moreover, application of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 together with Bay11-7082 maintained normal cell migration and knocking-down PI3K (p110α) by a specific siRNA inhibited JNKs phosphorylation while maintaining normal IκBα phosphorylation, indicating that PI3K and NF-κB signaling independently regulate JNKs activation. In addition, administration of bFGF or Bay11-7082 promoted rat skin wound repair and accelerated the invasion of fibroblasts.","This study sheds light on the mode of action of bFGF and identifies that the NF-κB-JNKs pathway is independent of the PI3K-JNKs pathway to accelerate fibroblast migration. In addition, bFGF and the relief of inflammation could be a favorable therapeutic approach for skin wound healing.",closed_qa
Does chronic lamotrigine alter the turnover of arachidonic acid within brain phospholipids of the unanesthetized rat : implications for the treatment of bipolar disorder?,"Drugs that are effective in treating the manic phase of bipolar disorder (lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate) upon chronic administration to rats decrease the turnover of arachidonic acid in their brain phospholipids. Lamotrigine may not be effective in the manic phase, but is effective in delaying the depressive phase and for treating rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Thus, lamotrigine provides a pharmacological tool to differentiate if downregulation of arachidonic acid turnover is specific to drugs effective in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. To test this hypothesis, rats were administered lamotrigine (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or vehicle intragastrically once daily for 42 days. In the unanesthetized rat, [1-(14)C]arachidonic acid was infused intravenously and arterial blood plasma was sampled until the animal was killed at 5 min, and its microwaved brain was subjected to chemical and radiotracer analysis. Using equations from our fatty acid model, we found that chronic lamotrigine compared with vehicle did not alter the net incorporation rate of plasma arachidonic acid into brain phospholipids, nor did it alter the turnover of arachidonic acid within brain phospholipids.","Chronic lamotrigine, which is effective in the depressive phase or rapid cycling bipolar disorder does not alter brain arachidonic acid turnover in the unanesthetized rat. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that drugs effective in treating the manic phase of bipolar disorder decrease brain arachidonic acid turnover.",closed_qa
Does small heterodimer partner/neuronal PAS domain protein 2 axis regulate the oscillation of liver lipid metabolism?,"In mammals, circadian rhythms are essential for coordinating the timing of various metabolic processes. The Clock gene regulates diurnal plasma triglyceride fluctuation through nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Shp; Nr0b2). Given that SHP is a critical regulator of metabolism in the liver, it is unknown whether SHP is necessary to coordinate metabolism and circadian rhythms. Shp(+/+) and Shp(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 background (n = 3-5/group) were fed a standard chow diet and water ad libitum. Serum and livers were collected at zeitgeber time 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. In vivo and in vitro assays included RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, very-low-density lipoprotein production, adenovirus overexpression and small interfering RNA knockdown, serum parameters, circadian locomotor activity, Oil Red O staining, transient transfection, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, gel-shift assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and western blottings. Shp deficiency had a robust global impact on major liver metabolic genes. Several components of the liver clock, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, coactivator 1 (Pgc-1α), neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2 (Npas2), and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (Ror)α/γ were sharply induced in Shp(-/-) liver. At the molecular level, SHP inhibited Npas2 gene transcription and promoter activity through interaction with Rorγ to repress Rorγ transactivation and by interacting with Rev-erbα to enhance its inhibition of Rorα activity. Conversely, Npas2 controlled the circadian rhythm of Shp expression by binding rhythmically to the Shp promoter, which was enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, but not nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Phenotypically, Npas2 deficiency induced severe steatosis in Shp(-/-) mice, which was attributed to the dysregulation of lipoprotein metabolism.",Shp and Npas2 crosstalk is essential to maintain hepatic lipid homeostasis.,closed_qa
Is stability of zinc finger nuclease protein enhanced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132?,"Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are powerful tools for gene therapy and genetic engineering. The characterization of ZFN protein stability and the development of simple methods to improve ZFN function would facilitate the application of this promising technology. However, the factors that affect ZFN protein stability and function are not yet clear. Here, we determined the stability and half-life of two ZFN proteins and examined the effect of MG132 (carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal-Hl), a proteasome inhibitor, on ZFN-mediated gene modifications. ZFN proteins were expressed in 293T cells after transfection of ZFN-encoding plasmids. We studied two ZFN pairs: Z-224, which targets the CCR5 gene, and K-230, which targets a region 230 kbp upstream of CCR5. Western blotting after treatment with cycloheximide showed that the half-life of these ZFN proteins was around two hours. An immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the ZFN interacts with ubiquitin molecules and undergoes polyubiquitination in vivo. Western blotting showed that the addition of MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, increased ZFN protein levels. Finally, a surrogate reporter assay and a T7E1 assay revealed that MG132 treatment enhanced ZFN-directed gene editing.","To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate ZFN protein stability and to show that a small molecule can increase ZFN activity. Our protein stability study should lay the foundation for further improvement of ZFN technology; as a first step, the use of the small molecule MG132 can enhance the efficiency of ZFN-mediated gene editing.",closed_qa
Does epidural anesthesia increase the incidences of urinary retention and hesitancy in micturition after ambulatory hemorrhoidectomy?,"This randomized, prospective study was designed to evaluate the role of various anesthesias in postoperative urinary retention and hesitancy in micturition in patients receiving hemorrhoidectomy on ambulatory basis. In a randomized order, 128 ambulatory patients, ASA physical status I or II, were divided into two groups to receive hemorrhoidectomy under epidural or local anesthesia. In all patients, the intraoperative intravenous fluid given was limited to 200 ml +/- 2 ml/kg/h of Ringer's lactate solution. Patients were requested to void urine voluntarily before discharge. The incidences of postoperative urinary retention and hesitancy in micturition were evaluated by telephone interview 24 hours after surgery. Neither the incidence of urinary retention, nor the incidence of hesitancy in micturition was significantly different between the two groups. Patients with age over 50 had a significantly higher incidence of hesitancy in micturition than younger patients. The incidence of hesitancy in micturition seemed higher in male patients (31.3%) than that in females (15.6%), but the difference was not statistically different (P = 0.0585).","With judicious intraoperative fluid restriction and voluntary voiding before discharge, epidural anesthesia does not increase the incidence of postoperative urinary retention or hesitancy in micturition following ambulatory hemorrhoidectomy.",closed_qa
Increase in invasive nonvaccine pneumococcal serotypes at two hospitals in Barcelona: was replacement disease to blame?,"Cumulative incidences of IPD, vaccine and nonvaccine serotypes (NVSTs), and main clinical presentations before (1998-2001) and after vaccine introduction (2005-2008) were compared. The incidence of IPD in children aged<2 years at Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol covering a population in which PCV7 was not widely used showed a nonsignificant increase from 29.9 to 58.8 per 100,000 child-years between both periods. Following vaccine introduction, there was a 2.5-fold increase in IPD caused by NVSTs in children aged<5 years. Analysis of trends in the almost fully vaccinated population of Hospital de Barcelona revealed a nonsignificant reduction in IPD incidence in children aged<2 years from 63.1 to 26.0 per 100,000 child-years. NVSTs in children aged<5 years showed a nonsignificant 1.7-fold increase in the vaccine period at this centre.",The paradoxical increase in invasive infections caused by NVSTs in these populations with different vaccine use suggests that these changes were not driven only by PCV7.,closed_qa
Is high-risk oral leukoplakia associated with aberrant promoter methylation of multiple genes?,"Early detection of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) is urgently needed to improve the prognosis and quality of life (QOL) of patients. Oral leukoplakias (OLs), known as the most common premalignant lesions in the oral cavity, often precede OSCCs. Especially, OLs with dysplasia are known to have a high risk of malignant transformation. Here, we searched for the promoter methylation characteristic of high-risk OLs. To identify methylation-silenced genes, a combined analysis of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) - CpG island (CGI) microarray analysis and expression microarray analysis after treatment with a demethylating agent was performed in two OSCC cell lines (Ca9-22 and HSC-2). The methylation statuses of each gene were examined by methylation-specific PCR. A total of 52 genes were identified as candidates for methylation-silenced genes in Ca9-22 or HSC-2. The promoter regions of 13 genes among the 15 genes randomly selected for further analysis were confirmed to be methylated in one or more of five cell lines. In OSCC tissues (n = 26), 8 of the 13 genes, TSPYL5, EGFLAM, CLDN11, NKX2-3, RBP4, CMTM3, TRPC4, and MAP6, were methylated. In OL tissues (n = 24), seven of the eight genes, except for EGFLAM, were found to be methylated in their promoter regions. There were significantly greater numbers of methylated genes in OLs with dysplasia than in those without dysplasia (p < 0.0001).",OLs at high risk for malignant transformation were associated with aberrant promoter methylation of multiple genes.,closed_qa

Do excitatory amino acids display compartmental disparity between plasma and synovial fluid in clinical arthropathies?,"Previous studies have demonstrated elevated levels of excitatory amino acids (EAA) glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with active arthritis. The source of SF EAA concentrations are thought in large part to be secondary to passive diffusion from the plasma across synovial membranes and less so, reflective of local synovial pathology. This descriptive report assesses the hypothesis that the SF EAA levels reflect inflammatory processes of the joint and are not dependent on plasma levels. Simultaneously drawn plasma and SF samples were obtained from 14 recently deceased cadavers and 10 patients with active arthritis. Plasma and SF EAA and other amino acid (AA) levels were determined by HPLC. SF: Plasma compartment concentration ratios were calculated to assess if SF EAA levels were similar to plasma levels. In the cadavers with no antemortem arthritis, the mean SF: Plasma ratios for Glu and Asp were 4-5-fold lower than the mean ratios seen for 9 other AAs, showing specific discrepancies of EAA levels between plasma and synovial fluid. In 9 patients with active arthritis, the SF: Plasma concentration ratios were higher in samples derived from inflammatory arthropathies.","Clinical samples demonstrated distinct, independent compartmental EAA concentrations between blood and joint compartments in support that local arthritic processes rather than plasma influence SF EAA concentrations. The SF EAA levels, whether from local cell production, local neurogenic sources, and/or transport-gradient mechanisms, parallel local pathology in the joint compartment and thus serve as surrogate biomarkers of local inflammatory processes.",closed_qa
"Is irisin , a novel myokine an independent predictor for sarcopenia and carotid atherosclerosis in dialysis patients?","In end-stage renal disease, deleterious effect of sarcopenia on cardiovascular disease has been explained mainly by chronic inflammation. However, evidence emerged that skeletal muscles mediate their protective effect against sarcopenia by secreting myokines. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effect of irisin, a recently introduced myokine, on the association between sarcopenia and cardiovascular disease in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Serum irisin concentrations were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 102 prevalent PD patients and 35 age- and sex-matched controls. To determine sarcopenia and cardiovascular disease, anthropometric indices including mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were measured. Serum irisin concentrations were significantly lower in PD patients than in controls (184.2 ± 88.0 vs. 457.2 ± 105.5 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In PD patients, univariate linear regression analysis showed that serum irisin was positively correlated with MAMC and thigh circumference, but negatively correlated with residual renal function and cIMT. Multivariate analysis revealed that MAMC (per 1 cm increase, B = 8.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77-16.79, P = 0.03) had an independent association with serum irisin. In addition, serum irisin was a significant independent predictor for carotid atherosclerosis even after adjustment for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in PD patients (per 1 g/mL increase, odds ratio = 0.990, 95% CI = 0.982-0.997, P = 0.007).",This study demonstrated that serum irisin was significantly associated with sarcopenia and carotid atherosclerosis in PD patients.

Is direct non-productive HIV-1 infection in a T-cell line driven by cellular activation state and NFκB?,"Molecular latency allows HIV-1 to persist in resting memory CD4+ T-cells as transcriptionally silent provirus integrated into host chromosomal DNA. Multiple transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for HIV-1 latency have been described in the context of progressive epigenetic silencing and maintenance. However, our understanding of the determinants critical for the establishment of latency in newly infected cells is limited. In this study, we used a recently described, doubly fluorescent HIV-1 latency model to dissect the role of proviral integration sites and cellular activation state on direct non-productive infections at the single cell level. Proviral integration site mapping of infected Jurkat T-cells revealed that productively and non-productively infected cells are indistinguishable in terms of genomic landmarks, surrounding epigenetic landscapes, and proviral orientation relative to host genes. However, direct non-productive infections were inversely correlated with both cellular activation state and NFκB activity. Furthermore, modulating NFκB with either small molecules or by conditional overexpression of NFκB subunits was sufficient to alter the propensity of HIV-1 to directly enter a non-productive latent state in newly infected cells. Importantly, this modulatory effect was limited to a short time window post-infection.","Taken together, our data suggest that cellular activation state and NFκB activity during the time of infection, but not the site of proviral integration, are important regulators of direct HIV-1 non-productive infections.",closed_qa
Is re-operation a safe and effective therapeutic strategy in recurrent WHO grade II gliomas within eloquent areas?,"To analyze the functional and oncological results after re-operation for recurrent WHO grade II Glioma located in eloquent regions.

At the first operation, we performed 14 subtotal and 5 partial resections. Eighteen patients returned to a normal socio-professional life. Nine patients received adjuvant treatment. At the second operation, we performed 1 total, 13 subtotal and 5 partial resections. Three patients with a preoperative neurological deficit improved, 13 remained unchanged, and 3 slight new deficits appeared. In 14 of the 17 patients with preoperative chronic epilepsy, the seizures were reduced or disappeared. Sixteen patients returned to a normal socio-professional life. Pathohistological examination showed that 11 tumours had progressed to high-grade glioma.

Do ethanol extracts of Saururus chinensis suppress ovalbumin-sensitization airway inflammation?,"The aerial part of Saururus chinensis has been used in folk medicine to treat several inflammatory diseases in China and Korea. Previously, our group reported that anti-asthmatic activity of an ethanol extract of Saururus chinensis (ESC) might occur, in part, via the inhibition of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) production, and degranulation reaction in vitro, as well as through the down-regulation of interleukin (IL)-4 and eotaxin mRNA expression in an in vivo ovalbumin-sensitization animal model. However, the effects of Saururus chinensis on eicosanoid generation, as well as Th2 cytokines and eotaxin production in an in vivo asthma model, have not been fully investigated. Moreover, it has not been determined whether ESC can ameliorate airway inflammation in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic activity of Saururus chinensis on ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized airway inflammation and its major phytochemical compositions. Asthma was induced in BALB/c mice by ovalbumin-sensitization and inhalation. ESC (10-100 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (5 mg/kg), a positive control, was administered 7 times orally every 12 h from one day before the first challenge to 1 h before the second challenge. The recruitment of inflammatory cells and hyperplasia of goblet cells were evaluated by H&E and PAS staining. Levels of Th2 cytokines, eotaxin, PGD(2) and LTC(4) were measured to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of ESC in OVA-sensitized mice. Contents of major components were analyzed by HPLC using a reversed-phase C18 column. ESC (10 mg/kg) suppressed allergic airway inflammation by inhibition of the production of IL-4 (P<0.001), IL-5 (P<0.05), IL-13 (P<0.001), eotaxin (P<0.001), PGE(2) (P<0.001), LTC(4) (P<0.001) in lung extract and IgE level (P<0.001) in the serum. In addition, ESC (50 mg/kg) reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and hyperplasia of goblet cells in the lung tissues. The anti-inflammatory effect of ESC was comparable to that of the positive control drug, dexamethasone. Its major phytochemical composition includes manassantin A, B and sauchinone.","These results suggest that ESC decreased inflammation and mucus secretion in the OVA-induced bronchial asthma model, and its anti-asthmatic activity may occur in part via the inhibition of Th2 cytokines and eotaxin protein expression, as well as through prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) generation. This effects may be attributed particularly to the presence of manassantin A, B and sauchinone major component evidenced by a HPLC analysis.",closed_qa
Does bufalin inhibit the Differentiation and Proliferation of Cancer Stem Cells Derived from Primary Osteosarcoma Cells through Mir-148a?,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in children and young adults. Chemoresistance is the most important cause of treatment failure in OS, largely resulting from presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, CSCs isolated from cancer cell lines do not necessarily represent those from primary human tumors due to accumulation of genetic aberrations that increase with passage number. Therefore, studies on CSCs from primary OS may be more important for understanding the mechanisms driving the chemoresistance of CSCs in OS. We established a primary culture of OS cells, known as C1OS, from freshly resected tumor tissue. We further isolated CSCs from C1OS cells (C1OS-CSCs). We analyzed the effects of bufalin, a traditional Chinese medicine, on the stemness of C1OS-CSCs. We also analyzed the microRNA (miR) targets of bufalin on the stemness of C1OS-CSCs. Moreover, we examined these findings in the OS specimen. Bufalin inhibited the stemness of C1OS-CSCs. Moreover, we found that miR-148a appeared to be a target of bufalin, and miR-148a further regulated DNMT1 and p27 to control the stemness of OS cells. This mechanism was further confirmed in OS specimen.","Our data suggest that bufalin may be a promising treatment for OS, and its function may be conducted through regulation of miR-148a.",closed_qa
Could the median-palate accommodate wide-bodied implants in order to support maxillary over-dentures?,"Atrophy of the alveolar bone is an irreversible multifactorial phenomenon, the rate of which varies between individuals and between the jaws. This atrophy of the alveolar ridges presents severe limitations for the oral rehabilitation of the edentulous patients and poses a clinical challenge to the prosthodontists and implant surgeons. The present research aimed to investigate whether the median-palate of elderly edentulous subjects is anatomically suitable for implant placement. A total of 32 samples were harvested from the maxillae of 16 human cadavers. One dentate male subject was included for contrast. Bone quality and quantity were analysed at two regions: the median-palate and the edentulous maxillary alveolar ridge. Samples were scanned through micro-CT, and the region of analysis (ROA) identified and dissected. Bone volume to tissue volume ratio (%BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and trabecular bone pattern factor (Tb.Pf) were evaluated for the two regions using Skyscan CTAn(®). The results of bone volume fraction obtained from CTAn(®) of the median-palatal region show higher values than the respective premolar sites in 12 of 15 (80%) edentulous samples. However, this difference was statistically non-significant (P = 0.06). Similarly, the trabecular number for 10 of 15 samples (66.6%) from the median-palate shows greater values than the respective premolar site (P = 0.07). Trabecular thickness of 10 of 15 (66.6%) premolar samples is larger than in the median-palatal region. However, these differences were also statistically non-significant (P = 0.25).

Is poor glycaemic control in diabetic patients a risk factor of myopia?,"As a consequence of an increasing prevalence of short-sightedness (myopia) in countries that have adopted western dietary patterns, it has been hypothesized that hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia induce myopia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), insulin dosage and myopia in diabetic patients. All type 1 diabetic patients aged 16-26 years [mean age 22.0, standard deviation (SD) 2.9] attending the eye clinic at Steno Diabetes Center, Copenhagen, in 1995-1997 were included in the study (n = 393). The following data were collected from the medical records from baseline to 2005: age at diabetes onset, age at baseline, sex, weight, HbA(1c), insulin dosage, refractive error, visual acuity and ocular diabetes complications. The prevalence of myopia [spherical equivalent (SE)<or = -0.5 D] was 53.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) +/- 5.29]at baseline. We followed 252 patients for 7.1 years (SD 2.2). In a logistic regression analysis, age at baseline [odds ratio (OR) 0.90 (95% CI 0.82; 0.99), P = 0.031], duration of diabetes at baseline [OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.91; 0.99), P = 0.047]and HbA(1c) [OR 1.26 (95% CI 1.03; 1.47), P = 0.022] were associated with myopia. The relative risk of a myopic shift was 1.7 (95% CI 1.28; 2.26) in patients aged 16-21 years and 1.6 (95% CI 1.19; 2.14) in patients with HbA(1c) above 8.8%. Insulin dosage was not related to myopia.",The prevalence of myopia in diabetic patients is considerably higher than in the background Danish population. Poor metabolic control of glucose is a suggested risk factor of myopia. The study suggests that myopia may be regarded as a complication of hyperglycaemia in diabetes.,closed_qa
Is homatropine 5% effective in reducing pain associated with corneal abrasion when compared with placebo?,"To compare the change in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain ratings over 24 h following mechanical corneal abrasion between patients receiving sixth hourly drops of either 5% homatropine or placebo. A triple blind randomized controlled trial was conducted on a convenience sample of eligible consenting adults who were randomized to receive either sixth hourly 5% homatropine (active) or 0.5% hypromellose (placebo) eye drops. VAS pain ratings were performed at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h whereas the study drug was instilled at 0, 6, 12 and 18 h. The primary outcome was attainment of a clinically significant reduction in pain on the VAS (>20 mm decrease) from enrolment to each time point. There were no significant differences in baseline variables or VAS pain ratings at any time point between those in the homatropine (n= 20) and placebo (n= 20) groups. The percentages of patients reporting a>20 mm VAS decrease at 12 h were 50% (95% CI -27.2-72.8) and 60% (95% CI -36.1-80.9) for the homatropine and placebo groups, respectively.",We found no significant difference in pain score reductions between the two groups but some level of therapeutic benefit is not excluded.,closed_qa
Do medication beliefs mediate between depressive symptoms and medication adherence in cystic fibrosis?,"Depression is a known barrier to regimen adherence for chronic conditions. Despite elevated depression rates and complex regimens for people with cystic fibrosis (CF), little is known about associations between depressive symptoms and CF adherence. One possibility is that depressive symptoms distort beliefs about medications, which may influence adherence. Adolescents and adults (N = 128; mean age = 29 ± 11 years, range = 16-63, 93% Caucasian) with CF reported on depressive symptoms and medication beliefs (self-efficacy, motivation, perceived importance, and outcome expectancies related to taking medications). Medication adherence was assessed objectively through pharmacy refill data. Cross-sectional structural equation models evaluated medication beliefs as a mediator between depressive symptoms and medication adherence. Twenty-three percent of participants exceeded clinical cutoffs for depressive symptoms. Participants took less than half of prescribed pulmonary medications (mean adherence rate = 44.4 ± 26.7%). Depressive symptoms were correlated with adherence (r = -.22, p < .05), and medication beliefs (b = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.24, -0.03]) significantly mediated this relation. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with less positive medication beliefs (b = -0.27, p < .01), which were associated with lower medication adherence (b = 0.49, p < .01).","Depressive symptoms are related to beliefs about and adherence to CF medications. Monitoring depressive symptoms and medication beliefs in routine CF care may help identify risks for nonadherence and facilitate interventions to reduce depression, adaptive medication beliefs, and ultimately improve adherence and CF management.

Does new insulin infusion protocol improve blood glucose control in hospitalized patients without increasing hypoglycemia?,"Aggressive treatment of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients can improve clinically important outcomes. At the University of Washington Medical Center a quality improvement project was conducted to develop and implement a standardized insulin infusion protocol for use throughout the institution. The insulin infusion protocol was piloted on critical and non-critical care inpatient units. Safety and efficacy data were collected for a one-month period on each unit. A total of 156 patients were evaluated. The incidence of hypoglycemia was lower for the study group than the historical controls, as was the mean percentage of time patients were hyperglycemic, 15% +/- 2.3% vs. 33% +/- 2.6% for the critical care subgroup (p < .0001) and 18% +/- 2.4% vs. 56% +/- 2.3% for the non-critical care subgroup (p < .0001).","The insulin infusion protocol better met the insulin requirements of our patients and achieved better glycemic control than previous protocols at the institution. In addition, there was no increase in hypoglycemia despite the use of the protocol in non-critical care units with higher patient-to-nurse ratios, suggests that insulin infusion therapy can be safely used outside of critical care units.",closed_qa
Does early childhood television viewing predict explosive leg strength and waist circumference by middle childhood?,"The relationship between early childhood television viewing and physical fitness in school age children has not been extensively studied using objective outcome measures. Using a sample of 1314 children from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, we examine the association between parental reports of weekly hours of television viewing, assessed at 29 and 53 months of age, and direct measures of second grade muscular fitness using performances on the standing long jump test (SLJ) and fourth grade waist circumference. Controlling for many potentially confounding child and family variables, each hour per week of television watched at 29 months corresponded to a .361 cm decrease in SLJ, 95% CI between -.576 and -.145. A one hour increase in average weekly television exposure from 29 to 53 months was associated with a further .285 cm reduction in SLJ test performance, 95% CI between -.436 and -.134 cm and corresponded to a .047 cm increase in waistline circumference, 95% CI between .001 and .094 cm.","Watching television excessively in early childhood, may eventually compromise muscular fitness and waist circumference in children as they approach pubertal age.",closed_qa
Is contact examination for tuberculosis in Hong Kong useful?,"The tuberculosis programme of the Hong Kong Government Tuberculosis and Chest Service. To determine the outcome of examination of household contacts in Hong Kong. A retrospective cohort study of all household contacts of 970 randomly selected index cases from a total of 5757 registered for treatment with the Chest Service. Of 2678 household contacts (three/index case) identified, 90% were examined; 41 active cases were found, at a rate of 1720/100000 (95%CI 1238-2329). The rate was highest among two extremes of age, 3604/100000 (95%CI 990-3615) in children < or = 5 years and 3347/100000 (95%CI 1456-6489) in those >60 years of age. Contacts of index cases whose sputum smear and culture were positive had the highest rate of disease, 2904/100000 (95%CI 1669-4673); but contacts with negative bacteriology also had a high rate of 1478/100000 (95%CI 678-2789). Active cases identified through contact tracing could be source cases rather than secondary cases. Eight per cent of children aged < or = 5 years had positive tuberculin reactions; as BCG vaccination is given to all newborns, with 99% coverage in Hong Kong in the past 30 years, it was difficult to estimate the rate of infection in these children.","In Hong Kong, an area with an intermediate burden of tuberculosis, contact investigation is a very useful procedure for active case finding.",closed_qa
Is peripheral joint inflammation in early onset spondyloarthritis specifically related to enthesitis?,"A pivotal MRI study of knee arthritis indicated that enthesitis was more frequently observed in established spondyloartritis (SpA) than rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subsequent MRI and ultrasound studies, however, failed to consistently demonstrate primary synovitis in RA versus primary enthesitis in SpA. Therefore, the current study aimed to reassess enthesitis versus synovitis in peripheral arthritis by a combined imaging and histopathological study in early untreated disease. MRI and mini-arthroscopic synovial biopsy sampling were performed in 41 patients with early untreated knee or ankle arthritis, who were diagnosed with SpA (n=13), RA (n=20) or crystal arthropathy (n=8) at follow-up. MRI evaluation of enthesitis and synovitis, and immunohistochemical characterisation of synovitis were performed by two observers blinded to diagnosis. MRI showed similar prevalence of perientheseal fluid/oedema (67% vs 75%), perientheseal bone marrow oedema (0% vs 10%) and entheseal enhancement (46% vs 47%) in SpA versus RA, respectively. The number and distribution of affected entheseal sites were not different between both diseases. The MRI synovitis score was significantly higher in SpA (median 1.4; IQR 1.1-1.5) compared with RA (median 0.5; IQR 0.0-1.3) (p=0.028). Synovial histopathology showed a numerical increase in infiltrating cells in SpA versus RA synovitis which reached significance for CD163 macrophages in the synovial sublining (p=0.030). There were no differences compared with the crystal arthropathy control group.",Enthesitis on MRI is not a specific feature of peripheral arthritis in recent onset SpA versus RA.

"Is serum level of uric acid , partly secreted from the failing heart , a prognostic marker in patients with congestive heart failure?","A recent study suggested that xanthine oxidase is activated in congestive heart failure (CHF). However, whether uric acid (UA) is secreted from the failing heart remains unknown, so it is currently unclear whether serum UA can provide prognostic information independent of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Serum UA was measured in the aortic root (AO) and the coronary sinus (CS) of 74 patients with CHF. The serum UA level was significantly higher in the CS than in the AO. The transcardiac gradient of UA (CS-AO) increased with the severity of CHF, inversely correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and positively correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic volume index. The plasma levels of norepinephrine, BNP, UA, and LVEF were monitored prospectively in 150 CHF patients for a mean follow-up of 3 years. High plasma levels of UA (p<0.001) and BNP (p<0.001) were shown by multivariate stepwise analysis to be independent predictors of mortality.","High plasma UA level, partly secreted from the failing heart, is a prognostic predictor independent of BNP in patients with CHF.

Does transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects improve cardiac remodeling and function of adult patients with permanent atrial fibrillation?,"Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of dysrhythmia associated with atrial septal defects (ASDs) in patients older than 40 years. However, little is known about cardiac remodeling after transcatheter closure in patients with permanent AF. This study was designed to compare cardiac events and remodeling effects after transcatheter closure in such patients. Clinical data of 289 adult patients older than 40 years who underwent ASD closure at our center were analyzed retrospectively. Of them, 63 patients with permanent AF were assigned to the case group, and the other 226 patients without permanent AF were assigned to the control group. Cardiac events and changes in left and right cardiac cavity dimensions before the procedure and 6 months after the procedure were compared between the two groups. Patients in the case group were significantly older than those in the control group. The right ventricular (RV) volume and right atrial (RA) volume were decreased significantly in both the groups during a median follow-up period of 6 months after closure (P < 0.001). The left atrial dimensions, left ventricular end-systolic dimensions, left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions and left ventricular ejection fraction showed no significant change before and after the procedure in both the groups. Changes of the RV volume and RA volume in the case group were significantly smaller than those in the control group (P = 0.005 and P < 0.001). The New York Heart Association cardiac function was improved in both the groups during the 6 months follow-up period.",The transcatheter closure of ASD can improve the cardiac remodeling and cardiac function in patients with or without AF.,closed_qa
Lumbar stenosis and systemic diseases: is there any relevance?,"A retrospective study of spinal stenosis patients admitted to Assaf Harofeh Medical Center Orthopedic Departments. To assess any correlation between systemic disease and spinal stenosis. Lumbar stenosis is a common spinal disease with various etiologies. No findings have been reported correlating spinal stenosis incidence with background diseases, although diabetes mellitus (DM) has been found to play a role in intervertebral disc degeneration and spondylolisthesis. Hospitalization records of patients with spinal stenosis admitted to Assaf Harofeh Medical Center Orthopedic Departments between 1984 and 1993 were checked for background diseases, age, and sex. The data collected were statistically evaluated for any correlation between spinal stenosis and chronic diseases and compared with the data published by the ""Israeli Bureau of Statistics"" and Israel's largest Health Maintenance Organization's chronic disease survey. Of 537 patients with spinal stenosis 57% (308) were males and (229) 43% females with an average age of 60+/-14 years. Diseases occurring with a high incidence were hypertension (HTN)-23.2% (compared with 7.8% in the general population), DM-13.6% (5.9%), ischemic heart disease (IHD)-11.9%, and hyperlipidemia-4.4%. Patients with spinal stenosis had no significant age and sex distribution difference compared with the general population and no such difference was found for patients suffering from HTN, IHD, or DM. Isolating the effect of DM on HTN and IHD revealed that HTN was a primary disease whereas IHD was secondary to DM with significant statistical validation (P=0.003).",To the best of our knowledge this is the first study linking spinal stenosis and DM or HTN. It was found that chronic diseases do not alter the natural age and sex distribution of spinal stenosis. The major question remaining concerns the biologic mechanism linking spinal stenosis and DM or HTN.,closed_qa
Does yM155 potently kill acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells through activation of the DNA damage pathway?,"Novel-targeted therapies are in rapid development for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to overcome resistance and decrease toxicity. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis gene family and chromosome passenger complex, is critical in a variety of human cancers, including ALL. A well-established suppressor of survivin has been the small molecule, YM155. Reports are identifying other mechanisms of action for YM155. Therefore, we sought to investigate the mode of action and role of YM155 for therapeutic use in the context of ALL. Primary ALL samples and ALL cell lines were interrogated with YM155 to identify drug sensitivity. Ph(+)ALL harboring the BCR-ABL1 oncogene were tested for any interaction with YM155 and the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Representative ALL cell lines were tested to identify the response to YM155 using standard biochemical assays as well as RNA expression and phosphorylation arrays. ALL samples exhibited significant sensitivity to YM155, and an additive response was observed with dasatinib in the setting of Ph(+)ALL. ALL cells were more sensitive to YM155 during S phase during DNA replication. YM155 activates the DNA damage pathway leading to phosphorylation of Chk2 and H2AX. Interestingly, screening of primary patient samples identified unique and exquisite YM155 sensitivity in some but not all ALL specimens.","These results are the first to have screened a large number of primary patient leukemic samples to identify individual variations of response to YM155. Our studies further support that YM155 in ALL induces DNA damage leading to S phase arrest. Finally, only subsets of ALL have exquisite sensitivity to YM155 presumably through both suppression of survivin expression and activation of the DNA damage pathway underscoring its potential for therapeutic development.",closed_qa
Is hemithyroidectomy the preferred initial operative approach for an indeterminate fine needle aspiration biopsy diagnosis?,"Fine needle aspiration biopsy represents the critical initial diagnostic test used for evaluation of thyroid nodules. Our objectives were to determine the cytological distribution, the utility of clinicopathologic characteristics for predicting malignancy and the true proportion of cancer among individuals who presented with indeterminate cytology and had undergone thyroid surgery for suspicion of cancer. We retrospectively reviewed 1040 consecutive primary thyroid operations carried out over an 8-year period at a tertiary care endocrine referral centre. Follicular neoplasm (FN), Hürthle cell neoplasm (HN), neoplasms suspicious for but not diagnostic of papillary carcinoma (IP) and neoplasms with cellular atypia (IA) were reviewed. In all, 380 individuals presented with cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. Of these, 252 (66%) patients had FN, 47 (12%) HN, 44 (12%) IP, 26 (7%) IA and 11 (4%) had mixed diagnoses. Biopsied lesions were found to be malignant on pathological evaluation in 102 (27%) patients: 49 (19%) with FN, 11 (23%) HN, 28 (64%) IP and 9 (35%) with IA. Hemithyroidectomy was adequate definitive treatment in 196 of 225 (87%) patients with FN and 39 of 42 (93%) with HN. Significant associations with a cancer diagnosis were identified for smaller tumour size in patients with FN (p = 0.004) and right thyroid lobe location in patients with IP (p = 0.012), although these factors were nonsignificant in the corrected analyses for multiple comparisons.","In a review of the experience at a Canadian centre, 4 operations were carried out to identify each cancer, and hemithyroidectomy was the optimal initial and definitive surgical approach for most patients.",closed_qa
Is platelet adhesion to dimeric beta-glycoprotein I under conditions of flow mediated by at least two receptors : glycoprotein Ibalpha and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 '?,"The major antigen implicated in the antiphospholipid syndrome is beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI). Dimerized beta2GPI binds to apolipoprotein E receptor 2' (apoER2') on platelets and increases platelet adhesion to collagen under conditions of flow. To investigate whether the interaction between dimerized beta2GPI and platelets is sufficiently strong to resist shear stresses. We studied the interaction of platelets with immobilized dimerized beta2GPI under conditions of flow, and further analyzed the interaction using surface plasmon resonance and solid phase immunoassays. We found that dimerized beta2GPI supports platelet adhesion and aggregate formation under venous flow conditions. Adhesion of platelets to dimerized beta2GPI was completely inhibited by the addition of soluble forms of both apoER2' and GPIbalpha, and the addition of receptor-associated protein and the removal of GPIbalpha from the platelet surface. GPIbalpha co-precipitated with apoER2', suggesting the presence of complexes between GPIbalpha and apoER2' on platelet membranes. The interaction between GPIbalpha and dimeric beta2GPI was of intermediate affinity (Kd = 180 nM) and Zn2+, but not Ca2+-dependent. Deletion of domain V from dimeric beta2GPI strongly reduced its binding to both GPIbalpha and apoER2'. Antibodies that inhibit the binding of thrombin to GPIbalpha inhibited platelet adhesion to dimeric beta2GPI completely, while antibodies blocking the binding of von Willebrand factor to GPIbalpha had no effect. Dimeric beta2GPI showed reduced binding to low-sulfated GPIbalpha compared to the fully sulfated form.",We show that platelets adhere to dimeric beta2GPI under both arterial and venous shear stresses. Platelets adhere via two receptors: GPIbalpha and apoER2'. These receptors are present in a complex on the platelet surface.,closed_qa
Is pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio correlated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as an independent prognostic indicator in breast cancer patients : a retrospective study?,"A high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be related to increased mortality in patients with lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, and pancreatic cancer. To date, the utility of NLR to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has not been studied. The aim of our study was to determine whether the NLR is a predictor of response to NAC and to investigate the prognostic impact of the NLR on relapse-free survival (RFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in patients with breast cancer who received NAC. We retrospectively studied patients who received NAC and subsequent surgical therapy for stage II-III invasive breast carcinoma at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital between 2001 and 2010. The correlation of NLR with the pathological complete response (pCR) rate of invasive breast cancer to NAC was analyzed. Survival analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of NLR. A total of 215 patients were eligible for analysis. The pCR rate in patients with lower pretreatment NLR (NLR < 2.06) was higher than those with higher NLR (NLR ≥ 2.06) (24.5 % vs.14.3 %, p < 0.05). Those patients with higher pretreatment NLR (NLR ≥ 2.1) had more advanced stages of cancer and higher disease-specific mortality. Through a multivariate analysis including all known predictive clinicopathologic factors, NLR ≥ 2.1 was a significant independent parameter affecting RFS (HR: 1.57, 95 % CI: 1.05-3.57, p < 0.05) and BCSS (HR: 2.21, 95 % CI: 1.01-4.39, p < 0.05). Patients with higher NLR (NLR ≥ 2.1) before treatment showed significantly lower relapse-free survival rate and breast cancer-specific survival rate than those with lower NLR (NLR <2.1) (log-rank p = 0.0242 and 0.186, respectively).","Pretreatment NLR < 2.06 is associated with pCR rate, suggesting that NLR may be an important factor predicting the response to NAC in breast cancer patients. NLR is an independent predictor of RFS and BCSS in breast cancer patients with NLR ≥ 2.1 who receive NAC.

Is sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) of the splenic red pulp identical to inflammatory pseudotumour?,"To report 16 cases of sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) of the splenic red pulp. Patients were selected in two phases. An initial group of seven patients was diagnosed with SANT based on the presence of angiomatoid nodules. Sheets of inflammatory fibrosis were found in three patients, resembling inflammatory pseudotumour (IPT); nine further cases of IPT were reviewed. Angiomatoid nodules were detected, leading to the diagnosis of SANT in all cases. The splenic mass (10-150 mm in diameter) was polycyclic, composed of multiple small nodules of loose connective tissue comprising myofibroblasts and a dense network of capillaries as well as some remnants of sinuses. Collagenous fibrosis surrounded them. Bands or large sheets of fibrosis, infiltrated by various inflammatory cells, particularly polytypic plasmacytes, resembling IPT, were present in 10 cases.","SANT of the red pulp is a distinct benign pseudotumorous lesion of the spleen characterized by the presence of angiomatoid nodules. We observed such angiomatoid nodules in all our cases of splenic IPT, which were not follicular dendritic cell or myofibroblastic tumours. We therefore recommend careful examination for angiomatoid nodules in all suspected cases of splenic IPT.",closed_qa
Does bixa orellana leaf extract suppress histamine-induced endothelial hyperpermeability via the PLC-NO-cGMP signaling cascade?,"Histamine is established as a potent inflammatory mediator and it is known to increased endothelial permeability by promoting gap formation between endothelial cells. Previous studies have shown that aqueous extract of Bixa orellana leaves (AEBO) exhibits antihistamine activity in vivo, yet the mechanism of its action on endothelial barrier function remains unclear. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the protective effect of AEBO against histamine-induced hyperpermeability in vitro. The endothelial protective effect of AEBO was assess using an in vitro vascular permeability assay kit. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used in the current study. HUVEC were pre-treated with AEBO for 12 h before histamine induction. Vascular permeability was evaluated by the amount of FITC-dextran leakage into the lower chamber. In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of AEBO, phospholipase C (PLC) activity, intracellular calcium level, nitric oxide (NO) concentration, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production and protein kinase C (PKC) activity were determined following histamine challenge. Histamine-induced increased HUVEC permeability was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with AEBO in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Upregulation of PLC activity caused by histamine in HUVEC was suppressed by pretreatment with AEBO. Pretreatment with AEBO also blocked the production of intracellular calcium induced by histamine in HUVEC. In addition, AEBO suppressed the NO-cGMP signaling cascade when HUVEC were challenged with histamine. Moreover, PKC activity was significantly abolished by pretreatment with AEBO in HUVEC under histamine condition.","In conclusion, the present data suggest that AEBO could suppress histamine-induced increased endothelial permeability and the activity may be closely related with the inhibition of the PLC-NO-cGMP signaling pathway and PKC activity.",closed_qa
Does regional brain atrophy evolve differently in patients with multiple sclerosis according to clinical phenotype?,"Progressive brain atrophy is a well-known feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). We characterized the spatial evolution of atrophy in different MS phenotypes. Dual-echo and T1-weighted MR images were obtained in 70 patients with MS and 10 healthy control subjects at entry and after 15 months. Within-group changes in regional atrophy were assessed by applying Structural Image Evaluation Using Normalization of Atrophy software and statistical parametric mapping analysis. Reported differences are for P <.001. During follow-up, patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) differences significant atrophy around the ventricular system; pericerebellar spaces; cerebellar tentorium; putamen; corpus callosum; cingulate sulcus; hippocampus; parieto-occipital fissure; lateral fissure; and frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. Patients with secondary progressive MS developed significant atrophy of the cingulate sulcus; pulvinar; caudate nucleus; anterior orbital gyrus; mammillary body; fourth ventricle; and regions of frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. Patients with primary progressive MS developed significant atrophy of the bilateral central sulcus; caudate nucleus; prepontine and quadrigeminal cisterns; lateral ventricle; and regions of frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. In all phenotypes, the development of atrophy in some regions was significantly correlated with the accumulation of T2- and T1-visible lesions and clinical disability (r = -0.57 to -0.86).","In MS, brain atrophy develops involving different structures in the different phenotypes. While ventricular enlargement is predominant in RRMS, cortical atrophy seems to be more important in the progressive forms. Measures of regional brain atrophy were significantly correlated with disability, suggesting that this approach is promising for bridging the gap between clinical and MR imaging findings in MS.",closed_qa
Is attitude toward epilepsy and driving affected by media coverage?,"The media have recently reported on car accidents related to persons with epilepsy in Japan. We were concerned that sensational media coverage may worsen the attitude toward epilepsy among non-medical persons. We carried out a questionnaire survey among non-medical students in order to evaluate the effects of media on the attitude toward epilepsy and the holding of a driving license in persons with epilepsy. The survey was performed using a structured questionnaire. The students were divided into two groups according to knowledge on the recent serious car accidents related to persons with epilepsy. In order to clarify the effects of media coverage, we compared the attitude toward epilepsy and driving in persons with epilepsy between those who knew about the accidents and those who did not. The proportion of students who were familiar with epilepsy was higher in those who knew about the accidents, whereas no significant difference was observed in attitude toward epilepsy. The proportion of students who opposed the idea of persons with epilepsy holding a driving license was not different according to knowledge of the car accidents, whereas that of students who opposed severe punishment of epilepsy patients in the case of a car accident was lower in those who knew about the accidents.","Media coverage did not affect the attitude of the participants toward restriction of driving license in persons with epilepsy, whereas the proportion of participants who object to severe punishment for car accidents in persons with epilepsy was decreased.",closed_qa
Is autonomic dysfunction associated with brief episodes of atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes?,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) and abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system in type 2 diabetic patients who did not have evidence of atrial fibrillation at baseline. In a multicentric cross-sectional controlled study, 1992 patients with type 2 diabetes were screened. All underwent ambulatory ECG recording for 48-hour at 3, 6, 9, and 12months. Heart rate variability (HRV) was used as indicator of autonomic activity. One hundred seventy-six diabetics with silent atrial fibrillation episodes (SAFE group) and 288 without silent atrial fibrillation (non-SAFE group) were enrolled. These selected diabetics were matched on clinical and anthropometric data to 120 control subjects without diabetes of the control group. HRV analysis evidenced that LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in the SAFE group than in the non-SAFE group (P<0.05) in the whole period of HM analysis. AF absolute burdens were positively correlated with LF/HF ratio (r=0.31, P<0.001).

Does fusion of 3D ultrasound images of the fetal femur improve boundary definition and volume measurement?,"To combine multiple 3D volumes of the same fetal femur into one composite image data set using image registration and wavelet-based fusion. Fused and single data sets were compared in terms of image quality and femur volume (FV) measurement repeatability. In healthy pregnant volunteers, six volumes of the same femur were acquired and fused into a composite data set. Image quality scores were given to the fused and single data sets by an independent assessor in a blinded fashion; repeatability of FV measurement was assessed using coefficients of variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Fusion was successful in 24 out of 25 cases. Median image quality score was 7/10 in fused data sets, compared to 6/10 in single data sets (p = 0.096). Repeatability of FV measurement was better in fused data sets (intraobserver CV 4.6% and ICC 0.987; interobserver CV 4.9%, ICC 0.985) compared to single ones (intraobserver CV 5.8%, ICC 0.977; interobserver CV 10.0%, ICC 0.931).

We sought to estimate the extent to which patients and clinicians agree on whether a cancer care decision was made during an outpatient encounter. We surveyed patients and clinicians immediately after an oncology encounter at a large, tertiary medical centre and calculated agreement in response to the single-item question, 'Was a specific decision about cancer care made during the appointment today?' Answer options were 'yes' and 'no'. Participants were 315 oncology patients, with any solid tumour malignancy and at any stage of management, and their clinicians (22 staff oncologists, nine senior fellows and five nurse practitioners). Patients and clinicians reported having made a cancer care decision in 184 (58%) and 174 (55%) of encounters, respectively. They agreed on whether a cancer care decision was made in 213 (68%) of encounters (chance-adjusted agreement was 0.34); in 56 of the 102 discordant encounters, the patient reported making a decision while the clinician did not. We found no significant correlates with discordance.","Patients and clinicians do not always agree on whether a cancer care decision was made. As such, measures that ask patients and/or clinicians to evaluate a decision-making process or outcome may be methodologically insufficient when they do not explicitly orient respondents towards the thing they are being asked to assess.",closed_qa
Does valsartan decrease type I collagen synthesis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"Fibrosis, as well as myocyte hypertrophy, is the major determinant of prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Valsartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, may improve myocardial fibrosis in patients with HCM. Twenty-three patients with HCM were randomly divided into 2 groups: 11 patients had valsartan added to conventional treatment (V group) and 12 patients received the conventional therapy (C group). Plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin T (TnT), aldosterone (ALDO), procollagen type I (PIP) and procollagen type III aminoterminal peptide (PIIINP) were measured before and 12 months after this study. Left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by echocardiography. PIP was decreased in the V group (123.2+/-63.1 ng/ml to 102.8+/-37.6, p<0.05), but unchanged in C group (110+/-40.5 ng/ml to 119.9+/-47.4, p=0.22). ALDO concentration was unchanged in the V group (88.5+/-26.2 pg/ml to 91.2+/-26.8, p=0.27), and increased in C group (92.6+/-36.6 ng/ml to 116.0+/-33.3, p<0.05). BNP, PIIINP, and TnT were unchanged by the treatment. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in either LVWT or LVEF.",Valsartan suppresses the synthesis of type I collagen in patients with HCM and this was associated with suppression of the increase in ALDO.,closed_qa
Is chondrolectin a novel diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for lung cancer?,"This study aims to identify molecules that might be useful as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and as targets for the development of new molecular therapies for lung cancer. We screened for genes that were highly transactivated in a large proportion of 120 lung cancers by means of a cDNA microarray representing 27,648 genes and found chondrolectin (CHODL) as a candidate. Tumor tissue microarray was applied to examine the expression of CHODL protein and its clinicopathologic significance in archival non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues from 295 patients. A role of CHODL in cancer cell growth and/or survival was examined by siRNA experiments. Cellular invasive effect of CHODL on mammalian cells was examined by Matrigel assays. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that strong positivity of CHODL protein was associated with shorter survival of patients with NSCLC (P = 0.0006), and multivariate analysis confirmed it to be an independent prognostic factor. Treatment of lung cancer cells with siRNAs against CHODL suppressed growth of the cancer cells. Furthermore, induction of exogenous expression of CHODL conferred growth and invasive activity of mammalian cells.",CHODL is likely to be a prognostic biomarker in the clinic and targeting CHODL might be a strategy for the development of anticancer drugs.,closed_qa
Does adult human liver contain intermediate-type proteasomes with different enzymatic properties?,"The 20S proteasome is the proteolytic core of the major intracellular protein degradative system, the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Since little is known about proteasomes of human liver, we have investigated the proteasome spectrum in adult human liver. 20S proteasomes were chromatographically purified from adult human liver and from HuH7 cells. They were divided into subpopulations and subtypes and characterized with regard to their proteolytic activities using short fluorogenic oligo- and long poly-peptide substrates. Their subunit composition was studied by immunoblotting. Proteasomes from adult human liver tissue can be separated into three subpopulations (I, II, III), each of which is composed of several subtypes, which total to a spectrum of 14 different subtypes. Two minor subtypes contain only the immuno-subunits β1i and β5i but not their standard counterparts; all others are intermediate subtypes containing β1 and β5 standard- and β1i and β5i immuno-subunits in various compositions. With regard to the proteolytic activities we observed that a decreasing content of subunit β1i in the subtypes goes along with a decreasing ratio of chymotrypsin-like/caspase-like activity, whereas the degradation rate of a 30 mer polypeptide substrate increased with decreasing β1i content. By comparison, 20S proteasomes from HuH7 cells do not contain immuno-subunits but are pure standard proteasomes, which can be separated into three subtypes.",These findings suggest that adult human liver contains a spectrum of 14 different 20S proteasome subtypes with different enzymatic properties reflecting most probably an adaptive response of liver cell functions to challenging factors during lifetime.,closed_qa
Do the effect of an autologous cellular gel-matrix integrated implant system on wound healing?,"This manuscript reports the production and preclinical studies to examine the tolerance and efficacy of an autologous cellular gel-matrix integrated implant system (IIS) aimed to treat full-thickness skin lesions. The best concentration of fibrinogen and thrombin was experimentally determined by employing 28 formula ratios of thrombin and fibrinogen and checking clot formation and apparent stability. IIS was formed by integrating skin cells by means of the in situ gelification of fibrin into a porous crosslinked scaffold composed of chitosan, gelatin and hyaluronic acid. The in vitro cell proliferation within the IIS was examined by the MTT assay and PCNA expression. An experimental rabbit model consisting of six circular lesions was utilized to test each of the components of the IIS. Then, the IIS was utilized in an animal model to cover a 35% body surface full thickness lesion. The preclinical assays in rabbits demonstrated that the IIS was well tolerated and also that IIS-treated rabbit with lesions of 35% of their body surface, exhibited a better survival rate (p = 0,06).","IIS should be further studied as a new wound dressing which shows promising properties, being the most remarkable its good biological tolerance and cell growth promotion properties.",closed_qa
Are timing of Spermarche and Menarche Associated with Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Among Korean Adolescents?,"This study examined the timing of menarche and spermarche and their associations with physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) after controlling for body mass index (BMI). Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine whether the timing of menarche in girls and spermarche in boys is associated with PA and SB independent of BMI in a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents (13-18 years; N = 74,186). After controlling for age, family economic status, and BMI, early timing of spermarche among boys was associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in PA and a lower likelihood of engaging in SB for < 2 hours during weekdays. By contrast, boys with late timing of spermarche were less likely to engage in PA and more likely to engage in SB for < 2 hours. Among girls, early or late timing of menarche was associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in PA and a lower likelihood of engaging in SB.","Timing of menarche in girls and spermarche in boys could be a marker for PA and SB among Korean adolescents. To promote PA and discourage SB among Korean adolescents, school-based, grade-specific interventions can be tailored by the absence or presence of menarche/spermarche.",closed_qa
Is gravity an important determinant of oxygenation during one-lung ventilation?,"The role of gravity in the redistribution of pulmonary blood flow during one-lung ventilation (OLV) has been questioned recently. To address this controversial but clinically important issue, we used an experimental approach that allowed us to differentiate the effects of gravity from the effects of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) on arterial oxygenation during OLV in patients scheduled for thoracic surgery. Forty patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheduled for right lung tumour resection were randomized to undergo dependent (left) one-lung ventilation (D-OLV; n=20) or non-dependent (right) one-lung ventilation (ND-OLV; n=20) in the supine and left lateral positions. Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) was measured as a surrogate for ventilation/perfusion matching. Patients were studied before surgery under closed chest conditions. When compared with bilateral lung ventilation, both D-OLV and ND-OLV caused a significant and equal decrease in PaO(2) in the supine position. However, D-OLV in the lateral position was associated with a higher PaO2 as compared with the supine position [274.2 (77.6) vs. 181.9 (68.3) mmHg, P<0.01, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. In contrast, in patients undergoing ND-OLV, PaO2 was always lower in the lateral as compared with the supine position [105.3 (63.2) vs. 187 (63.1) mmHg, P<0.01, ANOVA].",The relative position of the ventilated vs. the non-ventilated lung markedly affects arterial oxygenation during OLV. These data suggest that gravity affects ventilation-perfusion matching independent of HPV.,closed_qa
Is craniofacial morphology but not excess body fat associated with risk of having sleep-disordered breathing -- the PANIC Study ( a questionnaire-based inquiry in 6-8-year-olds )?,"We investigated the associations of dental occlusion, other craniofacial features and body fat with paediatric sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in a representative population sample of 491 Finnish children 6-8 years of age. Overweight and obesity were defined using age- and sex-specific body mass index cutoffs by International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) criteria. Body fat percentage was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Facial proportions, dental occlusion and soft tissue structures were evaluated by an orthodontist. Sleep was assessed by a sleep questionnaire administered by the parents. SDB was defined as apnoeas, frequent or loud snoring or nocturnal mouth breathing observed by the parents. The prevalence of SDB was 9.9 % with no difference between boys and girls. The median (interquartile range) of body fat percentage was 20.6 (17.4-27.1) in girls and 15.0 (11.4-21.6) in boys. Altogether 11.4 % of boys and 15.6 % of girls were classified as having overweight or obesity according to the IOTF criteria. There was no difference in the prevalence of overweight, obesity or body fat percentage between children with SDB and those without it. Children with tonsillar hypertrophy had a 3.7 times higher risk of suffering SDB than those with normal size tonsils after adjustment for age, sex and body fat percentage. Furthermore, children with cross bite had a 3.3 times higher risk of having SDB than those without cross bite, and children with a convex facial profile had a 2.6 times higher risk of having SDB than those with a normal facial profile.","Abnormal craniofacial morphology, but not excess body fat, is associated with an increased risk of having SDB in 6-8-year-old children. A simple model of necessary clinical examinations (i.e. facial profile, dental occlusion and tonsils) is recommended to recognize children with an increased risk of SDB.",closed_qa
Mystery shopping and alcohol sales: do supermarkets and liquor stores sell alcohol to underage customers?,"The Dutch national policy regarding alcohol and youth relies on retailers' willingness to refuse to sell alcohol to underage customers. This study examined unobtrusively whether supermarkets and liquor stores do indeed comply with the legal age restrictions for alcohol sales. A research protocol was developed based on the methodology of mystery shopping. Using the protocol, 150 supermarkets and 75 liquor stores were visited by 15-year-old adolescents who tried to buy soft alcoholic beverages (legal age, 16 years), and 75 liquor stores were visited by 17-year-old adolescents who tried to buy strong alcoholic beverages (legal age, 18). Of all 300 buying attempts, 86% were successful. In supermarkets, 88% of all attempts succeeded. In liquor stores, a difference was found between the purchase of strong alcohol by 17-year-olds (89%) and the purchase of soft alcoholic beverages by 15-year-olds (77%). In only 71 of all visits, mystery shoppers were asked for an ID. In 39% of these cases, they were still able to buy alcohol. Female adolescents were more successful in buying alcohol than male adolescents.",The results show that supermarkets and liquor stores generally fail to see the need for extra care when young customers try to buy alcohol. Legal age restrictions without enforcement and facilitation clearly do not suffice to protect adolescents from early exposure to alcohol.,closed_qa
Does activation of tumour-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor enhance the severity of murine allergic conjunctivitis?,"Tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) plays a role in the development of allergic asthma. The study aimed to determine whether TRAIL also participates in the development of experimental allergic conjunctivitis (EC), another allergic disease model. EC was induced in BALB/c mice by active immunisation with ragweed (RW) followed by RW challenge. To investigate whether TRAIL in the conjunctiva plays a role in the development of EC, conjunctival TRAIL expression in EC-developing mice was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the effect of subconjunctival injection of recombinant TRAIL on conjunctival inflammation was examined. To investigate whether TRAIL expressed in systemic immunocompetent cells plays a role in the development of EC, anti-TRAIL blocking Ab or anti-TRAIL receptor agonistic Ab was intraperitoneally injected into EC-developing mice, and conjunctival eosinophil infiltration was evaluated. Conjunctival TRAIL expression was not increased by EC induction. Moreover, subconjunctival injection of TRAIL protein in naive mice did not induce conjunctival inflammation. Thus, TRAIL in the conjunctiva is less likely to participate in the development of EC. Systemic treatment with anti-TRAIL blocking Ab in EC-developing mice did not affect the severity of EC. However, systemic treatment during the induction phase of EC with an agonistic Ab for the TRAIL receptor significantly augmented the severity of EC and increased Ag-recall splenocyte IFN-gamma production in vitro.",These results indicate that TRAIL receptor-expressing cells in lymphoid organ participate in the development of EC.,closed_qa
Is there a correlation between dietary habits and hemorrhoidal disease?,"It is empirically accepted that certain foods play a role in the pathogenesis of hemorrhoids or their acute exacerbation. The aim of this work was to determine whether there is a relationship between hemorrhoids and certain food-related or common toxin-related factors. Two groups of 50 subjects were compared. Group I was composed of 50 patients with hemorrhoid symptoms. Fifty volunteers with no proctologic abnormality were included in group II. We used a diet survey to compare total calorie, protein, carbohydrate, fat, food fiber, water, alcohol, salt, pepper, pimento, tea, and coffee intake was well as smoking habits. Episodes of constipation were also noted. Overall calorie intake, as well as protein, carbohydrate and fiber intake were similar in the two groups as were use of salt, coffee and tea. Dietary intake in group I was higher for fat (p = 0.02), alcohol (p = 0.01), pepper (p = 0.04, and pimento (p = 0.001). Subjects in group I drank less water (p = 0.008), smoked more (p = 0.01) and were more often constipated (p<0.001) than those in group II.",Our findings provide further arguments suggesting that dietary imbalance or smoking could be involved in the development of hemorrhoids. These factors should be evaluated in appropriate dietary inquiries. Epidemiological surveys would be required to confirm their possible causal effect.,closed_qa
Assessment of pain in critically ill children. Is cutaneous conductance a reliable tool?,"The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness and accuracy of skin conductance (SC) as a tool to evaluate the level of sedation and pain in pediatric critical patients during painful procedures and to compare it with hemodynamic variables, clinical scales, and bispectral index (BIS). This is a prospective observational study in 61 critical children undergoing invasive procedures. Hemodynamic data (heart rate and arterial blood pressure), clinical scales punctuation (Ramsay, COMFORT, and numeric rating pain scales), BIS, and the number of fluctuations of SC per second were collected before, during, and at the end of the procedure. The mean age of the patients was 42.9 (range, 1 month to 16 years). Seventy-two point six percent were postcardiac surgery patients. Nonmuscle-relaxed patients showed a moderate increase in heart rate (P = .02), numeric rating pain scales (P = .03), and Ramsay scale (P = .002). The number of fluctuations of SC per second increased significantly during the procedure (basal, 0.1; maneuver, 0.2; P = .015), but it never reached the level considered as pain or stress nor did it precede clinical scales or BIS. None of the variables studied showed a significant change during the procedure in muscle-relaxed patients.",Skin conductance was not found to be more sensitive or faster than clinical scales for the assessment of pain or stress in critical children undergoing painful procedures. Skin conductance was not useful in muscle-relaxed children.,closed_qa
Is the hypercoagulable state in atrial fibrillation mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor?,"Tissue factor (TF; an initiator of coagulation) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; a marker of angiogenesis) are involved in the hypercoagulable state associated with malignancy. We investigated their roles in chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), a condition also associated with increased risk of stroke and thromboembolism, as well as a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state. We studied 25 patients with AF (20 men; mean+/-SD age, 62+/-13 years) who were compared with 2 control groups in sinus rhythm: 30 healthy control subjects (17 men; mean age, 60+/-9 years) and 35 patient control subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD; 27 men; mean age, 60+/-12 years). Plasma levels of TF, VEGF, and the VEGF receptor sFlt-1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. VEGF, sFlt-1, and TF were significantly different between the 3 groups, with abnormal levels in AF and CAD patients compared with control subjects (P<0.001, P=0.022, and P=0.008, respectively). Among the AF patients, TF levels were significantly correlated with VEGF (Spearman's r=0.65, P<0.001) and sFlt (r=0.54, P=0.006) levels. Only TF and VEGF levels were significantly correlated in CAD patients (r=0.39, P=0.02). There were no significant correlations among the healthy control subjects.","Patients with chronic AF have high TF levels, in keeping with the prothrombotic state associated with this arrhythmia. The relationships between TF and VEGF and its receptor sFlt-1 in AF suggest a possible role for VEGF in the hypercoagulable state found in AF, as seen in malignancy and atherosclerosis.",closed_qa
Is bMI superior to symptoms in predicting response to proton pump inhibitor : randomised trial in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and normal endoscopy?,"In most patients undergoing endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the Western world, no macroscopic abnormality or evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection is identified. Following this negative investigation, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is usually prescribed. The aim of this study was to assess the value of such treatment compared with placebo and to identify predictors of response. Prospective parallel randomised study. Dyspepsia Research Clinic. 105 patients (49 men, median age 44 years, IQR 22) with normal endoscopy and H pylori negative with ongoing upper GI symptoms following 2-week run-in period. Intervention Full demographic symptom severity and characteristics were assessed and 24 h oesophageal pH metry and oesophageal manometry were performed prior to randomisation to 2 weeks of treatment with lansoprazole 30 mg/day or placebo (2:1), with reassessment of symptom severity during the second week of treatment. 50% reduction in Glasgow Dyspepsia Severity Score (GDSS). According to intention to treat analysis, the response was 35.7% for the active group and 5.7% for the placebo group (p < 0001). The only non-invasive independent predictor of response to PPI in multivariable analysis was the patient's body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.003). The association of BMI with response to PPI was apparent across the full range of quartiles (p values for trend=0.01). BMI had a similar predictive value to either 24 h oesophageal pH metry or manometry. Predominant symptom and symptom subgroups were unhelpful in predicting the response to PPI. Including all pretreatment assessments, only BMI (p < 0.05) and lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (p < 0.05) were independent predictors of response.",The response to PPI therapy is likely to be related to underlying acid reflux. The strong predictive value of BMI is probably due to its association with underlying reflux disease and the fact that it is a more objective and reproducible measure than symptom characteristics. It is recommended that BMI should be measured in patients with upper GI symptoms. Trial Registration Number ISRCTN 32863375.,closed_qa
Is cardiopulmonary bypass and intra-aortic balloon pump use associated with higher short and long term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement : a PARTNER trial substudy?,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the balloon-expandable Sapien transcatheter heart valve improves survival compared to standard therapy in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and is noninferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients at high operative risk. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients may require pre-emptive or emergent support with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and/or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) during TAVR due to pre-existing comorbid conditions or as a result of procedural complications. We hypothesized that patients who required CPB or IABP would have increased periprocedural complications and reduced long-term survival. In addition, we sought to determine whether preprocedural variables could predict the need for CPB and IABP. The study population included 2,525 patients in the PARTNER Trial (Cohort A and B) and the continuing access registry (CAR). Patients that received CPB or IABP were compared to patients that did not receive either, and then further divided into those that received support pre-TAVR and those that were placed on support emergently. One-hundred sixty-three patients (6.5%) were placed on CPB and/or IABP. The use of CPB or IABP was associated with higher 1 year mortality (49.1% vs. 21.6%, P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, utilization of CPB or IABP was an independent predictor of 30 day (HR 6.95) and 1-year (HR 2.56) mortality. Although mortality was highest in emergent cases, mortality was also greater in planned CPB and IABP cases compared with non-CPB/IABP cases (53.3% and 40.3% vs. 21.6%, P < 0.001).","These findings indicate that CPB and IABP use in TAVR portends a poor prognosis and its utilization, particularly in the setting of pre-emptive use, needs reconsideration.",closed_qa
Treatment of chronic hepatitis B in Asia-Pacific countries: is the Asia-Pacific consensus statement being followed?,"The Asia-Pacific consensus guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B state that the principal indicators for starting therapy are increased HBV DNA levels (>or =20,000 IU/ml for hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive status and>2,000 IU/ml for HBeAg-negative status) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels>2x the upper limit of normal. We aimed to determine whether clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region are treating patients with chronic hepatitis B according to the Asia-Pacific consensus statement on the management of chronic hepatitis B. An online survey of chronic hepatitis B treatment practices was prepared, consisting of 14 questions grouped into seven categories: patient statistics, treatment statistics, treatment decision, first-choice treatment, treatment duration, future directions and patient preference. In total, 124 respondents from 12 countries completed the survey. Most respondents indicated that detectable HBV DNA was either the first or second most important factor when deciding whether to initiate therapy. Many physicians were unsure about initiation of treatment in patients>40 years of age when ALT levels were within the normal range. Oral antiviral drugs were the most frequently used medication because of their effectiveness, safety and ability to provide sustained viral suppression. Conversely, the most important reasons for selecting interferon therapy were effectiveness, fixed duration of treatment and lack of drug resistance. Criteria for stopping treatment generally followed the recommendations included in the guidelines.",These data suggest that clinicians from the Asia-Pacific region use criteria beyond those advocated in treatment guidelines when deciding whether to initiate treatment in HBV-infected patients.,closed_qa
Long-term fenofibrate treatment impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and up-regulated pancreatic NF-kappa B and iNOS expression in monosodium glutamate-induced obese rats: is that a latent disadvantage?,"Fenofibrate, a PPAR alpha agonist, has been widely used in clinics as lipid-regulating agent. PPAR alpha is known to be expressed in many organs including pancreatic beta cells and regulate genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. Some reports based on cell lines or animals have provided evidences that PPAR alpha agonists may affect (increased or suppressed) beta cell insulin secretion, and several studies are producing interesting but still debated results. In this research, we investigated the long term effects of fenofibrate on beta cell function in a metabolic syndrome animal model, monosodium glutamate (MSG) induced obese rats. Obese MSG rats were administered by gavage with fenofibrate at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were performed to evaluate glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. We have used the hyperglycemic clamp technique to evaluate the capacity of beta cell insulin secretion. This technique provides an unbiased approach to understand the beta cell function in vivo. The changes of gene and protein expression in the pancreas and islets were also analyzed by Real-Time-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining. Fenofibrate reduced the plasma lipid levels within a few days, and showed no beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis or insulin sensitivity in obese MSG rats. But the animals treated with fenofibrate exhibited significantly decreased fasting plasma insulin and impaired insulin secretory response to glucose stimulation. Further studies confirmed that fenofibrate increased MDA level and decreased total ATPase activity in pancreatic mitochondrion, accompanied by the upregulation of iNOS and NF-kappa B and TNF alpha expression in pancreatic islets of obese MSG rats.","Long-term fenofibrate treatment disrupted beta cell function, and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in obese MSG rats, perhaps to some extent associated with the activated inflammatory pathway and increased formation of oxidative products, especially the up-regulation of NF-kappa B and iNOS expression in islets.",closed_qa
Awareness of disease among Italian cancer patients: is there a need for further improvement in patient information?,"Studies are available showing that cancer patients in southern Europe may be less well informed about their disease than patients in northern Europe and North America. In the framework of a survey aimed at exploring the meaning of quality of life for the Italian cancer patient, carried out all over Italy in a one-week time span on 6098 consecutive patients, two visual analogue scales evaluating severity and curability of disease were also submitted to the patients. Four patterns of patients' answers were defined: very easy/difficult-to-cure disease, and not-severe/severe disease. Multifactorial analyses were performed using logistic models for each of the four responses, assuming patient characteristics, time since diagnosis and disease extent as explanatory variables. Only 26% of 2088 patients with disseminated disease believed it to be 'difficult to cure', while 39% felt it to be 'easy to cure'. In the same subgroup of patients, only 47% found their disease 'severe'.","Authors were impressed by these unexpected results, which are therefore reported separately from the overall analysis of data, aimed at exploring the quality of life domains for the Italian cancer patient. In fact, they would suggest a great lack of awareness of the severity and curability of their disease in a large group of unselected Italian cancer patients. This may depend on various factors, including cross-cultural ones, but could also be partly related to inadequacies in the process by which the Italian patient is informed, and this should be further investigated.",closed_qa
Living donor kidney volume as a predictor of graft function: is there a role for proteinuria?,"The proposed mechanism by which nephron underdosing contributes to graft failure is hyperfiltration damage leading to proteinuria and nephron loss. We evaluated whether proteinuria had an impact on the relationship between graft size and outcome in living donor kidney transplantation. We analyzed 69 living donors and their recipients who underwent transplantation between 2003 and 2007. Transplanted kidney volumes were measured by 3-D helical computed tomography scanning. A transplant kidney volume-recipient body weight (Vol/Wt) ratio was calculated for each donor-recipient pair. The subjects were divided into tertiles according to Vol/Wt ratios: low (<2.0), medium (2.0-2.7) and high (>2.7). Recipient glomerular filtration rate (GFR) positively correlated with Vol/Wt ratio at 6, 12, and 24 months posttransplantation (r = .49, P<.001; r = .47, P<.001; r = .42, P<.001, respectively). Mean GFR increased significantly in graded fashion from low to high Vol/Wt ratio groups at 6, 12, and 24 months posttransplantation. Proteinuria did not differ between the three groups during 24 months after transplantation. Upon multivariate analysis, donor age, recipient age, and Vol/Wt ratio showed significant impacts on graft function.",Vol/Wt ratio displayed a significant independent effect on graft function in living donor kidney transplantation. This close association did not appear to be related to the degree of proteinuria during 24 months.,closed_qa
Is distortion product otoacoustic emissions test useful in children undergoing cisplatin treatment?,"Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapy agent that has several adverse effects, such as ototoxicity. Evaluation of hearing loss due to cisplatin therapy in children is difficult. The purpose of this study was to compare the validity of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) with pure tone audiometry (PTA) in assessing hearing loss in children under cisplatin therapy. We reviewed the files of 26 children aged between 2 and 15 years; 14 were girls. All were under treatment with cisplatin for malignancy. PTA and DPOAEs were obtained at the same session. Three subjects were studied twice; thus, there were 29 sets of studies. Determining a cut-off point at 45 dB HL for PTA and 4 dB SPL difference for DPOAEs, diagnostic specificity for the latter was 0.97 while sensitivity was 0.57.",DPOAEs represent a highly valuable test for evaluating hearing loss due to cisplatin treatment.

Does tissue oxygen during a critical developmental period control the death and survival of photoreceptors?,"To study the death of photoreceptors in normally developing and dystrophic retina and to test the role of hypoxia in causing that death. Death of photoreceptors was detected in the albino, hooded, and Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) strains of rat, and in the rabbit and cat, using the TUNEL technique. Retinas of selected ages from animals raised normally and those from rat pups raised for periods in hyperoxia (75% oxygen) or hypoxia (10% oxygen) were studied. In all species and strains examined, a naturally occurring wave of photoreceptor death was detected during the last stages of retinal development. In the albino rat, this wave, which began approximately at postnatal day 15 (P15) and peaked at P22, was reduced by hyperoxia and was intensified by hypoxia, producing a ""hypoxic dystrophy"" of photoreceptors. In the RCS rat, photoreceptor death also commenced at approximately P15 and then proceeded to exhaustion. This degeneration was greatly reduced by hyperoxia. In the RCS rat, hyperoxia was effective in photoreceptor rescue only during a discrete period, from P16 to P22. In the albino rat, the effectiveness of hypoxia in inducing photoreceptor death was much greater between P15 and P21 than at earlier ages, or in the adult.","During a critical period extending approximately from P15 to P22, tissue oxygen levels strongly influence photoreceptor death and survival in dystrophic and normally developing strains of rat. This period is evident in normal development as a period of naturally occurring photoreceptor death and is evident experimentally as a period during which hyperoxia is effective in rescuing dying photoreceptors and during which hypoxia is effective in inducing death of otherwise viable photoreceptors.",closed_qa
Does igE-mediated facilitated antigen presentation underlie higher immune responses in peanut allergy?,"Peanut allergy poses significant healthcare problems, because its prevalence is increasing in many countries, and it is rarely outgrown. To explore the immunological mechanisms that underlie peanut allergy and tolerance, we compared the peanut-specific responses of peanut-allergic (PA) and nonallergic (NA) individuals. We measured peanut-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation using tritiated thymidine. The frequency of peanut-specific T cells amongst PBMC was determined by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labelling. The role of IgE-dependent facilitated antigen presentation (FAP) in modulating proliferation was investigated by depleting IgE from plasma with anti-IgE-coated beads and then assessing PBMC proliferation in the presence of IgE-depleted or nondepleted plasma. We found that peanut-specific PBMC proliferation is higher and peaks earlier in PA than in NA donors. We investigated the immunological mechanisms that could underlie these differences. We found that both PA and NA have memory responses to peanut, but the frequency of peanut-specific T cells is higher in PA than in NA. Facilitated antigen presentation could cause both the higher proliferation and precursor frequency in PA. Facilitated antigen presentation activity in vitro was confirmed by showing that IgE depletion decreases proliferation, while adding IgE back restores it.","Our results identify FAP as a mechanism that underlies higher responses to peanut in PA. In these individuals, high levels of peanut-specific IgE could furthermore maintain long-term allergic T-cell responses. We raise the question whether, in the future, therapies targeting IgE such as anti-IgE antibodies may be used to suppress these T-cell responses.",closed_qa
Does orally administered S-1 suppress circulating endothelial cell counts in metastatic breast cancer patients?,"S-1 is an oral cytotoxic preparation that contains tegafur. Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) is a metabolite of tegafur that is known to suppress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenic activity. The aim of this study was to determine the change in circulating endothelial cell (CEC) counts, GBL levels, and angiogenesis-related factors during S-1 administration in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. Patients with HER2-negative MBC were eligible. S-1 was administered orally twice daily in a 4 week on/2 week off cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Blood was collected on the following: days 1, 43, 85 (before each cycle of S-1 administration), days 15, 57 (1 h after S-1 administration), and day 29. The CellSearch(®) system was used to count the CECs. The gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was used to measure plasma GBL and 5-FU levels. Levels of VEGF were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A total of 18 patients were enrolled. The plasma GBL levels on days 15 and 57 were 41.3 ± 15.8 and 41.0 ± 11.2 ng/mL, respectively. The CEC levels decreased on day 15, and significantly low levels were maintained until day 85 (P = 0.002 vs day 1). The plasma VEGF levels significantly decreased on day 15 (P = 0.012 vs day 1) and had a tendency to decrease until day 57.","This exploratory study showed that GBL levels increased, VEGF levels decreased, and CEC levels were suppressed during S-1 administration. S-1 appears to have anti-angiogenic activity.",closed_qa
Does a new haemodialysis catheter-locking agent reduce infections in haemodialysis patients?,"Intravenous catheters for haemodialysis increase the risk of sepsis. This study investigates the use of a taurolidine/citrate catheter-locking agent for patients receiving hospital-based haemodialysis, auditing the number and cost of infections before and after its introduction. The incidence and cost of treatment of catheter sepsis occurring in all patients receiving haemodialysis via a line were investigated over 6-month periods before and after introducing the taurolidine/citrate line-locking agent. A reduction of 4.62 infections per 1000 catheter days, or 88.5%, was shown after the introduction of the new line-locking agent. The total costs of line infections in the first 6 months were 52,500 euros, (41,000 pounds); after the introduction of the taurolidine/citrate locks, these reduced to 33,300 euros, (26, 000 pounds), a reduction of 19,200 euros (15,000 pounds).","The use of a taurolidine/citrate haemodialysis catheter-locking agent in our haemodialysis population has significantly reduced the line sepsis rate, with a positive impact on morbidity, mortality and cost.",closed_qa
"Is tegaserod , a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 receptor partial agonist , devoid of electrocardiographic effects?","Certain GI prokinetic agents have been shown to affect cardiac repolarization, which may be associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 receptor partial agonist tegaserod is a novel promotile agent developed for the treatment of functional motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the study was to investigate the cardiac safety profile of tegaserod through analysis of electrocardiographic data from clinical studies conducted in patients with IBS and a study conducted in healthy male subjects. In three randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies, 2516 IBS patients with symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation received tegaserod 2 or 6 mg b.i.d. (n = 1679) or placebo (n = 837) for 12 wk. In an additional study, 36 healthy male subjects received iv. single doses of tegaserod (0.8 mg to 20 mg) or placebo. Standard 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at baseline and during treatment. Baseline values were compared with data collected during the treatment period. The proportion of patients with prolongation of the QTc interval was the same for placebo and tegaserod, as was the frequency of overall electrocardiographic abnormalities. No ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia was observed. Comparable electrocardiographic results were obtained during placebo and tegaserod treatment. In healthy volunteers, tegaserod at i.v. doses resulting in plasma concentrations up to 100 times those measured after therapeutic doses (6 mg b.i.d.) did not influence electrocardiographic parameters.",Tegaserod is devoid of electrocardiographic effects and is not expected to adversely influence cardiac function. These data confirm preclinical findings.,closed_qa
Does endothelial dysfunction occur prior to clinical evidence of polycystic kidney disease?,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a monogenic disease with an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive form of inheritance (ARPKD), is the most common genetic cause of renal dysfunction and end-stage renal failure. In addition to the development of cysts, the autosomal form of PKD is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, a marker of vascular disease. Whether vascular endothelial dysfunction is also present in ARPKD, and its relationship with renal dysfunction remain to be determined. ARPKD rats (PCK model) and controls were studied at 6 and 10 weeks of age, and mean arterial pressure and renal function were measured. Aortic endothelial function was assessed using organ chamber techniques. Aortic endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated, characterized and their function studied. Compared to controls, ARPKD animals had a decrease in the vasorelaxation to endothelium-dependent vasodilators, even prior to changes in mean arterial pressure or renal function. The abnormal vasoreactivity was corrected with L-arginine (a precursor of nitric oxide, NO), while the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) was unchanged. Furthermore, isolated ECs from 6-week-old ARPKD animals showed increased oxidative stress, with preserved eNOS expression and abnormal patterns of migration and angiogenic capacity (measured by the scratch and tube formation assays, respectively).","ARPKD leads to impairments in aortic vascular function and ECs at an early stage, which can have significant functional consequences, potentially representing a novel therapeutic target in this disease.",closed_qa
Is computerized tomography useful in identifying abdominal catastrophes in patients presenting with peritonitis?,"Peritonitis is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Symptoms may persist, requiring an emergency laparotomy. Although increasingly used, we find that, in PD patients, abdominal computerized tomography (CT) is ineffective in determining significant pathology. This study was undertaken to assess the diagnostic utility of CT for the identification of intra-abdominal collections in PD patients presenting with peritonitis. A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients that underwent abdominal CT scanning in the context of severe PD peritonitis in the past 2 years. All of these patients had at least one CT scan preoperatively. 133 patients presented with PD peritonitis; 19 patients had a contrast CT procedure (12 females, 7 males). Average age was 59.2 years; mean duration on PD was 43.8 months. 13 of 19 patients had gram-negative bacillary peritonitis, 6 of whom had polymicrobial peritonitis; 4 patients had fungal peritonitis and 2 had Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis. 26 CT scans were done in 19 patients an average of 10 days after presentation. 21 of 26 scans revealed no collections of surgical interest. 12 laparotomies were performed, with an average delay of 10.4 days from presentation to laparotomy. Of the 12 laparotomies, 6 found a drainable collection not seen on CT. Seven of the 19 patients died (37%) and no patient was able to return to PD.","PD patients requiring emergency laparotomy following PD peritonitis have a high mortality rate. A negative abdominal CT in the setting of ongoing symptoms should not be taken as reassuring, nor should it delay proceeding to emergency laparotomy.",closed_qa
Does fetal Stomach Position predict Neonatal Outcomes in Isolated Left-Sided Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia?,"We sought to determine the relationship between the degree of stomach herniation by antenatal sonography and neonatal outcomes in fetuses with isolated left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). We retrospectively reviewed neonatal medical records and antenatal sonography of fetuses with isolated left CDH cared for at a single institution (2000-2012). Fetal stomach position was classified on sonography as follows: intra-abdominal, anterior left chest, mid-to-posterior left chest, or retrocardiac (right chest). Ninety fetuses were included with 70% surviving to neonatal discharge. Stomach position was intra-abdominal in 14% (n = 13), anterior left chest in 19% (n = 17), mid-to-posterior left chest in 41% (n = 37), and retrocardiac in 26% (n = 23). Increasingly abnormal stomach position was linearly associated with an increased odds of death (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.1-10.9), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.9-16.7), nonprimary diaphragmatic repair (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.5), prolonged mechanical ventilation (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.3-15.6), and prolonged respiratory support (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.6-9.9). All fetuses with intra-abdominal stomach position survived without substantial respiratory morbidity or need for ECMO.",Fetal stomach position is strongly associated with neonatal outcomes in isolated left CDH. This objective tool may allow for accurate prognostication in a variety of clinical settings.,closed_qa
Does gene expression profiling of aging reveal activation of a p53-mediated transcriptional program?,"Aging has been associated with widespread changes at the gene expression level in multiple mammalian tissues. We have used high density oligonucleotide arrays and novel statistical methods to identify specific transcriptional classes that may uncover biological processes that play a central role in mammalian aging. We identified 712 transcripts that are differentially expressed in young (5 month old) and old (25-month old) mouse skeletal muscle. Caloric restriction (CR) completely or partially reversed 87% of the changes in expression. Examination of individual genes revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of increased p53 activity in the older muscle. To determine whether the increase in p53 activity is associated with transcriptional activation of apoptotic targets, we performed RT-PCR on four well known mediators of p53-induced apoptosis: puma, noxa, tnfrsf10b and bok. Expression levels for these proapoptotic genes increased significantly with age (P < 0.05), while CR significantly lowered expression levels for these genes as compared to control fed old mice (P < 0.05). Age-related induction of p53-related genes was observed in multiple tissues, but was not observed in young SOD2+/- and GPX4+/- mice, suggesting that oxidative stress does not induce the expression of these genes. Western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels for both p21 and GADD45a, two established transcriptional targets of p53, were higher in the older muscle tissue.",These observations support a role for p53-mediated transcriptional program in mammalian aging and suggest that mechanisms other than reactive oxygen species are involved in the age-related transcriptional activation of p53 targets.,closed_qa
"Is the 26-kilodalton , AhpC homologue , of Helicobacter pylori also produced by other Helicobacter species?","The 26 kDa protein, which is an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) homologue, has earlier been described as specific for Helicobacter pylori. The aims of this study were to analyse whether this protein, or the corresponding gene, could be identified in other Helicobacter species. Two different monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), which recognise the 26 kDa protein in H. pylori, were used in immunoblots to determine the presence of the protein in 10 Helicobacter species. PCR was performed in order to analyse whether the gene was detectable and the PCR products were sequenced. Southern and Northern blot analyses were done on chromosomal DNA and total RNA, respectively, isolated from some selected Helicobacter species in order to compare the genes and mRNA transcripts to H. pylori. The 26 kDa protein was identified in H. nemestrinae (primate), H. acinonychis (cheetah), H. bilis (mouse), H. felis (cat) and H. salomonis (dog) but not in H. mustelae (ferret), H. cinaedi (human), H. canis (dog), H. fennelliae (human) or H. pullorum (poultry). By PCR the gene was also recognised in H. mustelae, H. cinaedi and H. pullorum. The PCR products showed high sequence homology (66-98%) compared to H. pylori. The gene was also highly conserved in four H. pylori strains (94-99% homology). Southern blot showed that the H. nemestrinae and H. acinonychis chromosomal DNA contained a single copy of the gene and the Northern blot analyses indicated mono-cistronic transcription of the gene in these two species, as has been found in H. pylori.",A gene similar to ahpC was found in eight out of 10 Helicobacter species analysed.,closed_qa
Does heparin induce apoptosis through suppression of AKt in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells?,"Heparin is a polysulfated glycosaminoglycan that has been shown to have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in addition to its anticoagulant effects. The present work investigated the effects of unfractioned heparin (UFH) on cell growth and apoptosis in four oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines and the mechanism(s) underlying its actions using MTT assay, Annexin-V-FITC and Western blotting. Treatment with UFH resulted in significant reduction in cell viability and increase in apoptosis in three of the four tested cell lines. Further, such treatment resulted in a significant decrease in phosphorylated AKt, and consequently led to activation of the mitochondrial pathway in heparin-sensitive cells. Moreover, pretreatment with UFH significantly increased the apoptosis induced by cisplatin.","These findings indicate that heparin induces apoptosis through suppression of AKt, and suggest a potential utility of heparin for development of less toxic chemotherapy in treatment of oral SCC.",closed_qa
Is association of physical activity with lower type 2 diabetes incidence weaker among individuals at high genetic risk?,"We examined whether or not the association of physical activity with type 2 diabetes incidence differs according to several types of genetic susceptibility. In a large prospective cohort with 821 incident cases of type 2 diabetes, we examined interactions of physical activity with: (1) each of 65 type 2 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); (2) a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising all 65 SNPs; (3) two GRSs comprised of SNPs implicated in insulin resistance (IR) and insulin secretion; (4) GRSs for fasting insulin (FI) and fasting glucose. We found a significant interaction of physical activity and the type 2 diabetes GRS (p interaction = 0.016), suggesting a weaker protective effect of physical activity in those at high genetic risk. Based on the interactions observed with the IR GRS (p interaction = 0.046) and the FI GRS (p interaction = 0.042), it appears that the overall type 2 diabetes GRS interaction most likely occurs through genetic susceptibility to IR as opposed to insulin secretion. Furthermore, this interaction was more pronounced in women (p interaction = 0.0025) than in men (p interaction = 0.46). No single SNP stood out as displaying a strong interaction with physical activity.","We conclude that although physical activity appears to have an overall protective effect on type 2 diabetes, this putative effect is weakest among individuals with high genetic risk for type 2 diabetes and IR.",closed_qa
Can the pectoral fascia integrity be preserved during subfascial breast augmentation through the axillary approach?,"Although many authors recently have reported good results with subfascial breast augmentation, it still is controversial whether the integrity of the pectoral fascia can be preserved. Some authors think the pectoral fascia will be broken during the operation because it is thin and weak. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether the integrity of the pectoral fascia can be preserved during subfascial breast augmentation through an axillary incision without endoscopic assistance. For this study, 10 patients underwent subfascial augmentation mammaplasty through the axillary approach. The technique was used for patients with small or moderate breasts. The pockets were made with the fingers. The area beyond the reach of the fingers was dissected using a breast dissector. Then the pocket and major pectoral fascias were examined with an endoscope. The endoscope was used only to inspect the fascia and major pectoral muscle after the subfascial dissection was completed. The fascia and surgical effects were evaluated. The integrity of 11 (55%) of 20 pectoral fascias in 10 patients was preserved during the surgery. Four fascias (20%) were broken at about the fourth intercostal space or at the fifth costa. In five breasts (25%), the superficial layer of the pectoral muscle was split, but the integrity of the fascia was maintained. All the patients except one with asymmetric breasts achieved satisfactory results. There was no active bleeding, hematoma, infection, or fibrous capsule contracture during the follow-up period.","The integrity of most pectoral fascias (11 + 5 fascias) could be preserved through the axillary approach during subfascial breast augmentation without endoscopic assistance. Even if the lower portion of the pectoral fascia was broken, this did not interfere with the aesthetic outcome or the normal postoperative recovery.",closed_qa
Does heat preconditioning prevent oxidative stress-induced damage in the intestine and lung following surgical manipulation?,"The intestine is increasingly recognized as a primary effector of distant organ damage, such as lung, following abdominal surgery. Surgical manipulation of the intestine generates oxygen free radicals resulting in mucosal damage. Heat preconditioning has been proposed to prevent various stress-induced alterations in cells and tissues, including oxidative stress. This study examined the effect of heat preconditioning on oxidative stress-induced damage to the intestine and lung, following surgical manipulation. Control rats and rats pretreated with heat were subjected to surgical manipulation by opening the abdominal wall and handling the intestine as done during laparotomy. Intestine and lung were assessed for damage by histology and markers of oxidative stress. Surgical manipulation resulted in ultrastructural changes in the intestine. Biochemical alterations in the enterocytes were evident, with increased xanthine oxidase activity resulting in production of superoxide anion and with a decrease in antioxidant status. Gut manipulation also resulted in neutrophil infiltration and oxidative stress in the lung as assessed by histology, myeloperoxidase activity, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status. Heat conditioning before surgical manipulation had a protective effect against this intestinal and lung damage.",This study suggests that mild whole-body hyperthermia before surgery might offer protection from postoperative complications.,closed_qa
Is ovomucoid superior to egg white testing in predicting tolerance to baked egg?,"Children with egg allergy may tolerate baked egg products. Ovomucoid specific IgE (sIgE) antibody levels have been suggested to predict outcomes of baked egg challenges. We determined the relationship of ovomucoid and egg white sIgE levels and egg white skin prick test (SPT) wheal size with baked egg challenge outcome. Retrospective review of 1186 patients who underwent ovomucoid sIgE blood testing. Subset analysis was of 169 patients who underwent baked egg food challenges. Egg white sIgE, ovomucoid sIgE, and egg white SPT were different among those eating regular egg, eating baked egg only, or avoiding all egg (P < .001 for all). One hundred forty-two of 169 patients (84.0%) passed baked egg challenges. We were able to establish >90% predictive values for passing baked egg challenge for egg white sIgE, ovomucoid sIgE, and egg white SPT.No patient with egg white SPT wheal <3 mm failed a baked egg challenge. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of egg white sIgE, ovomucoid sIgE, and egg white SPT showed areas under the curve of 0.721, 0.645, and 0.624, respectively. No significant difference was observed among these immunologic parameters in their abilities to predict baked egg challenge outcome (P [ .301).","Most children with egg allergy in this study passed baked egg challenges. Ovomucoid sIgE, although a useful clinical predictor of baked egg tolerance, was not superior to egg white SPT or sIgE in predicting outcome of baked egg challenge.",closed_qa
Are bone marrow endothelial progenitors defective in systemic sclerosis?,"Vascular abnormalities represent the main component of the pathobiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc), progressing from structural derangements of the microcirculation with abortive neoangiogenesis to final vessel loss. Since circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are important in the vascular repair process, we undertook this study to examine their numbers in the peripheral blood (PB) of SSc patients and to evaluate whether their status is related to impaired quantitative and/or qualitative aspects of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Circulating EPCs from 62 SSc patients were evaluated by flow cytometry and characterized as CD45 negative and CD133 positive. BM EPCs, identified as CD133 positive, were isolated from 14 SSc patients and grown to induce endothelial differentiation. In addition, progenitor numbers and functional properties of hematopoietic and stromal compartments were analyzed by various assays. We found that EPCs were detectable in the PB of patients with SSc, and their number was significantly increased in patients with early-stage disease but not in those with late-stage disease. All of the examined BM samples contained reduced numbers of EPCs and stromal cells, both of which were functionally impaired. Both endothelial and stromal progenitors expressed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, indicating that BM is strongly induced to differentiate into the endothelial lineage; furthermore, only BM EPCs from patients with early disease led to endothelial differentiation in vitro.","This study provides the first demonstration that in SSc, there is a complex impairment in the BM microenvironment involving both the endothelial and mesenchymal stem cell compartments and that this impairment might play a role in defective vasculogenesis in scleroderma.",closed_qa
Do hDL-associated factors provide additional prognostic information for coronary artery disease as determined by multi-detector row computed tomography?,"A significant relationship has been noted between the lipid profile and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) using invasive coronary angiography. We tested the hypothesis that the severity of CAD as determined by a non-invasive method, multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT), is also associated with lipidemic factors. The subjects included 195 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography using MDCT because of suspected CAD. The number of significantly stenosed vessels (VD) as evaluated by MDCT, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), free cholesterol (FC), phospholipid (PL), remnant-like lipoprotein particle-cholesterol (RLP-C), apolipoprotein (apo)-B, apo-C3, apo-E, and highly-sensitive C-reactive protein were determined. The subjects were divided into diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-DM groups. The HDL-associated PAF-AH level in the DM group was significantly lower than that in the non-DM group. The VD determined by MDCT was significantly associated with hypertension, administration of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL-associated (H)-HDL, H-PL, H-FC and RLP-C. Multivariate analysis revealed that VD determined by MDCT was most closely correlated with HDL-C.",Lower levels of HDL-C may be an indicator for and provide additional information regarding the severity of CAD compared with other lipidemic factors.,closed_qa
Does leptin promote the mobilization of vascular progenitor cells and neovascularization by NOX2-mediated activation of MMP9?,"Bone marrow (BM) progenitors participate in new vessel formation and endothelial repair. The leptin receptor (ObR) is expressed on hematopoietic cells; however, the effects of leptin on BM progenitor cells and their angiogenic potential are unknown. In the present study, we show that the short-term administration of leptin (over five consecutive days) into wild-type mice increased the number of circulating, BM-derived sca-1(+), flk-1(+) vascular progenitors, 95 ± 1.7% of which also expressed ObR. Ex vivo stimulation of BM cells with leptin enhanced the expression of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (NOX2), and the leptin-induced increase in reactive oxygen species production, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression and circulating soluble KitL levels was absent in mice lacking NOX2. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injections of leptin improved perfusion and increased the number of BM-derived, CD31-positive endothelial cells in ischaemic hindlimbs after femoral artery ligation. The effects of leptin on the mobilization of sca-1(+), flk-1(+) cells and neovascularization were abolished in mice transplanted with BM from ObR-deficient and in NOX2(-/-) mice.","Our findings suggest that the angiogenic effects of leptin involve sca-1(+), flk-1(+) vascular progenitor cells mobilized from the BM in response to ObR-mediated activation of NOX2, increased MMP9 expression, and sKitL release.",closed_qa
Do cariogram caries risk profiles in adolescent orthodontic patients with and without some salivary variables?,"To compare the Cariogram caries risk profiles with and without salivary buffer capacity and mutans streptococci (MS) counts in adolescents with fixed orthodontic appliances. The sample consisted of 90 healthy Greek adolescents who were undergoing orthodontic treatment. The Cariogram risk model was applied through a questionnaire and clinical and salivary examinations. The actual chance of avoiding new caries was calculated, and participants were categorized into three groups (0-40%  =  high caries risk, 41-60%  =  medium caries risk, and 61-100%  =  low caries risk) using a nine-item Cariogram or by excluding either salivary buffer capacity or MS or both. Cohen's Kappa statistical analysis was used for comparing the Cariogram outcome with and without salivary variables. The distribution of variables was compared by nonparametric marginal homogeneity tests. Using the Cariogram with nine variables, 62% of the patients were assigned to the high caries risk category, 13% to the medium risk category, and 24% to the low risk category. Omission of salivary buffer capacity did not alter the risk categories significantly, while more subjects were assigned to the medium risk category when MS counts were excluded. The difference between the nine-item Cariogram and the MS-reduced version, however, was not statistically significant (P  =  .07).",The Cariogram model may be used both with and without salivary tests for risk grouping in orthodontic practice.,closed_qa
Do parasagittal biopsies add minimal information in repeat saturation prostate biopsy?,"To compare the outcome and efficacy of lateral biopsies with parasagittal biopsies in detecting prostate cancer during repeated biopsies performed using the ""saturation"" technique, which includes 24 cores per biopsy. Prostate biopsy may miss cancer in up to 38% of men eventually found to harbor the disease. Lateral biopsies are more likely than parasagittal biopsies to detect adenocarcinoma according to the findings of several studies. A total of 100 patients, average age 62.1 +/- 7.9 years, underwent repeated transrectal ultrasound-guided saturation biopsy. The study group included 31 patients with previous biopsy results demonstrating high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 7 with atypia, and 62 with benign prostatic tissue but persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Patients had undergone an average of 1.65 previous biopsies. The average prostate-specific antigen level was 9.4 +/- 6.8 ng/mL. Biopsies were obtained from five sectors on each side and examined histologically. Cancer was detected in 25 (25%) of the 100 patients. Malignancy was identified in the lateral cores of all patients with positive biopsies. Parasagittal biopsy cores were positive in association with a lateral-based biopsy in 9 (36%) of the 25 malignancies, for an overall parasagittal biopsy core rate of 9% (9 of 100 patients). No cancers were detected in the parasagittal biopsy cores alone.","Inclusion of parasagittal zone biopsy cores proved to have a low yield in detecting cancer on repeated biopsy. As all patients found to have cancer in the parasagittal biopsy cores also had cancer on the lateral biopsy cores, most time and effort can be spent obtaining lateral biopsy cores to increase the sensitivity on repeated saturation biopsy.",closed_qa
Does perception of lactose intolerance impair health-related quality of life?,"Chronic conditions impair perception of well-being. Malabsorption of lactose is the most frequent form of malabsorption and manifests as lactose intolerance. There is a lack of information regarding their impact on self-perception of health. The objective of this study is to determine the subjective impact of self-reported lactose intolerance or objective lactose malabsorption on patient health by using a patient-reported outcome to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and modification of lactose-containing food diet. A 3-year prospective, cross-sectional study was performed in patients referred for a lactose hydrogen breath test. Patients were asked about their subjective opinion relative to their lactose tolerance and completed a validated, specific questionnaire to determine symptoms of intolerance during habitual consumption of dairy. A 50-g lactose breath test was then performed. Patients were grouped as absorbers vs malabsorbers and tolerant vs intolerants. A total of 580 patients were included (median age 30 years, 419 female). Overall, 324 patients (56%) considered themselves lactose intolerant and that perception was associated with avoidance of dairy consumption (55% vs only 9% of self-defined tolerants). Self-perception of intolerance was associated with lower HRQOL scores (median, 60 vs 70, P<0.01). In contrast, lactose objective malabsorption was not clearly associated with dairy avoidance (41% of malabsorbers avoided dairy vs 31% of absorbers). However, HRQOL scores were also significantly lower in malabsorbers than in absorbers (60 vs 70 respectively, P<0.001).","Subjective perception of lactose intolerance affects the decision to avoid dairy even more than objective malabsorption. However, both self-perception of lactose intolerance and objective lactose malabsorption are associated with poorer perceived quality of life.",closed_qa
Is dobutamine stress echocardiography predictive of middle and late term outcomes in mitral stenosis patients?,"Forty-four consecutive patients with known MS were submitted, between April 1998 and July 1999, to basal and DSE.

Does metformin alter the risk of lung cancer : a case-control analysis?,"Metformin use has been linked to a decreased cancer risk. We explored the association between use of metformin or other antidiabetic drugs and the risk of lung cancer. We assessed the association between metformin, and other antidiabetic drugs and lung cancer using a case-control analysis in the UK-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Cases were people with an incident diagnosis of lung cancer. Up to 6 controls per case were matched on age, sex, calendar time, general practice, and number of years of active history in the GPRD. The contribution of potential confounders including tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, and co-morbid conditions to diabetes was evaluated in univariate models, and final results were adjusted for BMI and smoking. Long-term use (≥40 prescriptions) of metformin was not associated with an altered risk of lung cancer (adj. OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.97-1.50. Long-term use of sulfonylureas was linked to a marginally decreased risk of lung cancer (adj. OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.90. This risk decrease was observed in men (adj.

Sitting playfully: does the use of a centre of gravity computer game controller influence the sitting ability of young people with cerebral palsy?,An investigative study to examine whether sitting ability could be improved through the use of a suite of computer games operated by leaning in one of four directions in a seated position. Young people with cerebral palsy played with a suite of computer games controlled using a sitting platform that can detect changes in the distribution of pressure. A randomized cross-over trial with two periods of three months involving intervention or no intervention was used. Sitting ability was measured at the beginning and end of each period with participants acting as their own controls. Statistically significant improvements were seen in two elements of box sitting using the Chailey levels (shoulder girdle position and spinal profile) and in five elements of the Sitting Assessment for Children with Neuromotor Dysfunction across both reach and rest phases of the assessment.,"The study provides evidence to suggest that a meaningful and engaging therapeutic activity, such as using computer games controlled by leaning the upper body, can help to improve sitting ability in children with neuromotor dysfunction. Further work is required to understand fully what effects such activities have on the various components of sitting ability. [Box: see text].",closed_qa
Does multiple oral dosing of ketoconazole increase dog exposure to ivermectin?,"The parasiticide ivermectin and the antimicrobial drug ketoconazole are macrolides that interact with P-glycoprotein. We investigated the effects of ketoconazole at a clinical dose on the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin, a CYP3A substrate with low hepatic clearance. Beagle dogs received a single subcutaneous injection of ivermectin at 0.05 mg/kg alone (n=6) or in combination with a daily oral dose of ketoconazole 10 mg/kg over 5 days before and after ivermectin administration (n=6). The plasma kinetics of ivermectin and its metabolite were followed over 15 days by HPLC analysis. Co-administered ketoconazole induced a higher plasma concentration and longer residence time of ivermectin in dogs, leading to a substantial increase in the overall exposure of the animal to the drug. Ketoconazole does not interfere with the production of the ivermectin metabolite but it may rather inhibit the elimination of the parental drug by interfering with P-gp transport.",Multiple oral dosing of ketoconazole dramatically altered the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin in dogs leading to an increase in systemic exposure to the drug. Neurotoxicity of ivermectin means that inhibition of the P-gp function at the blood-brain barrier during polytherapy using P-gp inhibitors must be taken into consideration.,closed_qa
Early diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Is it possible to define a cutoff value of infected cells in BAL fluid?,"To assess the usefulness of quantification of infected cells (ICs) in BAL fluid for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A prospective study. A medico-surgical ICU in a tertiary health-care institution. One hundred thirty-two patients (mean age, 52 +/- 19 years). The suspicion of nosocomial pneumonia was strong in these patients: all had fever (>or = 38.5 degrees C), purulent tracheal aspirates, leukocytosis (>or = 10,000 cells per cubic millimeter), and new or persistent radiographic lung infiltrates. One hundred sixty-three samples (BAL and protected specimen brushes [PSB]) were obtained. VAP was present in 56 cases. The diagnosis was excluded in the remaining 107 cases. The IC count was performed on 100 cells in BAL fluid. The percentage of IC was significantly higher (12.6 +/- 12.4 vs 1.14 +/- 3.39; p<0.0001) in patients with pneumonia: the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.888 and a threshold of 2% of IC corresponded to a sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 80%, a positive predictive value of 69%, and a negative predictive value of 90%.",It is possible to define a threshold of IC in BAL fluid with a good reliability by using an ROC curve. This technique is useful for the early diagnosis (<2 h) of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients and allows a rapid and appropriate treatment of most of the patients with suspected VAP.,closed_qa
Is high expression of Lewis y/b antigens associated with decreased survival in lymph node negative breast carcinomas?,"There is sufficient evidence that blood group related Lewis antigens are tumour-associated molecules. The Lewisy and Lewisb antigens are complex carbohydrates that are over-expressed by breast, lung, colon and ovarian cancers. The SC101 mAb is a unique Lewisy/b binding antibody that binds to native and extended Lewisy and Lewisb haptens, displaying no cross reactivity with H type 1, H type 2, Lewisx or normal blood group antigens. Immunohistochemical detection of Lewisy/b was performed on 660 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded breast tumour specimens using a streptavidin-biotin peroxidase technique. Tissue from these patients had previously been included in tissue microarrays. This cohort comprises a well characterized series of patients with primary operable breast cancer diagnosed between 1987 and 1992, obtained from the Nottingham Tenovus Primary Breast Carcinoma Series. This includes patients 70 years of age or less, with a mean follow up of 7 years. Of the breast carcinomas, 370 of 660 (56%) were negative for Lewisy/b expression, 110 (17%) cases showed a low level of expression (<25% of positive cells) and only 54 cases (8%) showed extensive expression of Lewisy/b (>75% of positive cells). We found significant positive associations between histological grade (p < 0.001), Nottingham Prognostic Index (p = 0.016), tumour type (p = 0.007) and the level of Lewis y/b expression. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of Lewisy/b positive tumour cells and survival in lymph-node negative patients (p = 0.006).","The unique epitope recognised by SC101 mAb on Lewisy/b hapten is over-expressed on breast tumour tissue compared with normal breast. In this large series of invasive breast cancers, higher expression of Lewisy/b was more often found in high grade and poor prognosis tumours compared to good prognosis cancers. Moreover, in lymph node negative breast carcinomas, over-expression of Lewisy/b hapten was associated with significantly decreased patient survival.",closed_qa
Do peritoneal fluid concentrations of the cytokine RANTES correlate with the severity of endometriosis?,"Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disorder in which the concentration and activation of peritoneal macrophages are increased. The goal of this study was to quantify pelvic fluid concentrations of two cytokines involved in macrophage recruitment and activation. A case-control study of women undergoing pelvic surgery was conducted by collecting peritoneal fluid from 12 women without evidence of endometriosis (controls), 12 with mild, and 12 with moderate to severe endometriosis. Concentrations of RANTES and interferon gamma, soluble cytokines known to recruit and activate macrophages, were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Pelvic fluid concentrations of RANTES are elevated in women with endometriosis and the levels correlate with the severity of disease. By contrast, concentrations of interferon gamma appear unaffected by the presence of or severity of endometriosis.","The findings indicate that RANTES, a cytokine with potent chemotactic activity for human monocytes, may play an important role in the recruitment of peritoneal macrophages in endometriosis.",closed_qa
Do impairments of the medial olivocochlear system increase the risk of noise-induced auditory neuropathy in laboratory mice?,"Impairments of the medial olivocochlear system (MOCS) increase the risk of environmentally induced auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). ANSD is a problem in the neural transmission of auditory information that accounts for 10% to 15% of the cases of pediatric hearing loss. The underlying mechanisms of the disorder remain poorly understood, but noise exposure is an important risk factor. The goal of this study was to identify environmental conditions and genetic predispositions that lead to ANSD. Our approach was based on the assumption that noise induces ANSD by impeding the functional maturation of the brain's sound coding pathways. Because the MOCS adjusts the sensitivity of the inner ear to noise, impairments of this feedback are predicted to increase the disruptive effects of environmental exposures. An animal model of ANSD was created by rearing mice in noise. MOCS protection was assessed by comparing the incidence of noise-induced ANSD among knockout mice lacking feedback and wild-type (WT) controls. The mice were screened for ANSD with distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem responses, and behavioral measures of gap detection. Single-unit recording procedures were used to link these deficits to impaired synaptic transmission in the ventral cochlear nucleus. ANSD manifested in noise-reared mice as intact distortion product otoacoustic emissions, abnormal auditory brainstem responses, and impaired gap detection. The phenotype was not observed among quiet-reared WT mice but was occasionally noted among noise-reared WT mice. The incidence of ANSD significantly increased among knockout mice, especially when they were reared in noise.",Noise promotes ANSD by altering the functional maturation of the brain's temporal pathways. Noise-induced impairments are reduced by the sound-attenuating effects of the MOCS. Noise levels do not need to be unnaturally loud to constitute significant risk in MOCS-compromised individuals.,closed_qa
Does indoxyl sulfate reduce superoxide scavenging activity in the kidneys of normal and uremic rats?,"Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a uremic toxin that accelerates the progression of chronic renal failure (CRF). This study aimed at determining whether IS impairs antioxidative systems (redox status) in the kidney. IS was orally administered to normal and subtotally nephrectomized (three fourths and five sixths) rats (CRF rats) for 2 weeks. By use of in vivo and ex vivo electron spin resonance spectroscopy, the kidney redox status was evaluated using carbamoyl-PROXYL as a radical spin probe in living rats, and the kidney superoxide scavenging activity was measured. Immunohistochemistry of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the kidney was performed. Administration of IS increased serum and kidney levels of IS and serum creatinine and decreased creatinine clearance. CRF rats showed reduced spin reduction rate, prolonged half-life of the spin probe, and reduced superoxide scavenging activity and SOD-positive areas in the kidney as compared with normal rats. Administration of IS further reduced radical spin reduction rate, prolonged half-life of the spin probe, and reduced superoxide scavenging activity and SOD-positive areas in the kidneys.","Administration of IS reduced superoxide scavenging activity in the kidneys of normal and CRF rats. Thus, the nephrotoxicity of IS may be induced by impairing the antioxidative systems in the kidney.",closed_qa
Does depolarization-evoked secretion require two vicinal transmembrane cysteines of syntaxin 1A?,"The interactions of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) with syntaxin 1A (Sx 1A), Synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kD (SNAP-25), and synaptotagmin, couple electrical excitation to evoked secretion. Two vicinal Cys residues, Cys 271 and Cys 272 in the Sx 1A transmembrane domain, are highly conserved and participate in modulating channel kinetics. Each of the Sx1A Cys mutants, differently modify the kinetics of Cav1.2, and neuronal Cav2.2 calcium channel. We examined the effects of various Sx1A Cys mutants and the syntaxin isoforms 2, 3, and 4 each of which lack vicinal Cys residues, on evoked secretion, monitoring capacitance transients in a functional release assay. Membrane capacitance in Xenopus oocytes co-expressing Cav1.2, Sx1A, SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin, which is Bot C- and Bot A-sensitive, was elicited by a double 500 ms depolarizing pulse to 0 mV. The evoked-release was obliterated when a single Cys Sx1A mutant or either one of the Sx isoforms were substituted for Sx 1A, demonstrating the essential role of vicinal Cys residues in the depolarization mediated process. Protein expression and confocal imaging established the level of the mutated proteins in the cell and their targeting to the plasma membrane.","We propose a model whereby the two adjacent transmembranal Cys residues of Sx 1A, lash two calcium channels. Consistent with the necessity of a minimal fusion complex termed the excitosome, each Sx1A is in a complex with SNAP-25, Syt1, and the Ca(2+) channel. A Hill coefficient >2 imply that at least three excitosome complexes are required for generating a secreting hetero-oligomer protein complex. This working model suggests that a fusion pore that opens during membrane depolarization could be lined by alternating transmembrane segments of Sx1A and VGCC. The functional coupling of distinct amino acids of Sx 1A with VGCC appears to be essential for depolarization-evoked secretion.",closed_qa
Does ethanol binging exacerbate sinusoidal endothelial and parenchymal injury elicited by acetaminophen?,"The pathophysiology of binge drinking of ethanol and its potentiation of acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity has received very little attention. To evaluate if ethanol binging sensitizes hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) and liver to APAP toxicity. The histopathological responses to APAP were evaluated in the livers of mice gavaged with APAP alone, following a single, week-end type ethanol binge (4 g/kg every 12 h x 5 doses) or three weekly binges. Six hours after APAP, 600 mg/kg elicited severe centrilobular necrosis together with hemorrhagic congestion and infiltration of erythrocytes into the Space of Disse through large gaps that had formed in SEC. There was no evidence of parenchymal injury at 2 h, but gaps already were formed through the cytoplasm of the SEC by coalescence of fenestrae. A single binge followed by 300 mg/kg APAP elicited SEC and parenchymal injury equivalent to 600 mg/kg APAP alone at 2 and 6 h. The responses were exacerbated following three binges. Lower glutathione levels in the liver were shown in ethanol-binged animals.",Ethanol binging increases APAP hepatotoxicity. SEC are an early target for APAP-induced injury and ethanol binging enhances the SEC injury prior to evidence of parenchymal cell injury.,closed_qa
Does a novel assay uncover an unexpected role for SR-BI in LDL transcytosis?,"Retention of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol beneath the arterial endothelium initiates an inflammatory response culminating in atherosclerosis. Since the overlying endothelium is healthy and intact early on, it is likely that LDL passes through endothelial cells by transcytosis. However, technical challenges have made confirming this notion and elucidating the mechanisms of transcytosis difficult. We developed a novel assay for measuring LDL transcytosis in real time across coronary endothelial cell monolayers; we used this approach to identify the receptor involved. Murine aortas were perfused ex vivo with LDL and dextran of a smaller molecular radius. LDL (but not dextran) accumulated under the endothelium, indicating that LDL transcytosis occurs in intact vessels. We then confirmed that LDL transcytosis occurs in vitro using human coronary artery endothelial cells. An assay was developed to quantify transcytosis of DiI-LDL in real time using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. DiI-LDL transcytosis was inhibited by excess unlabelled LDL, while degradation of the LDL receptor by PCSK9 had no effect. Instead, LDL colocalized partially with the scavenger receptor SR-BI and overexpression of SR-BI increased LDL transcytosis; knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced it. Excess HDL, the canonical SR-BI ligand, significantly decreased LDL transcytosis. Aortas from SR-BI-deficient mice were perfused ex vivo with LDL and accumulated significantly less sub-endothelial LDL compared with wild-type littermates.",We developed an assay to quantify LDL transcytosis across endothelial cells and discovered an unexpected role for SR-BI. Elucidating the mechanisms of LDL transcytosis may identify novel targets for the prevention or therapy of atherosclerosis.,closed_qa
Do [ Trends in cholesterol levels in the adult population of São José do Rio Preto ]?,"To develop a survey about risk factors for atherosclerosis in a > or = 20-year-old population from São José do Rio Preto, and compare the results with those obtained in a similar survey in 1991. Quantitative survey with sample stratified by sex and age. The individuals (a total of 646, 303 men) where contacted in outpatient facilities from the Health Secretary and other populated sites, distributed by geographic zone and social class of different neighborhoods. The standard error of the survey was 4%, and the confidence interval was 95%. A) Mean HDL-cholesterol (only in 1997): male gender 43.7 +/- 15 mg/dL, female gender 49.6 +/- 13.5 mg/dL (p < 0.001, 95% CI 3.7 a 8.1). B) Mean total cholesterol in 1991 vs 1997: for the global population 192.5 +/- 48.9 mg/dL vs 190.5 +/- 42.5 mg/dL (p = NS); for men 187.6 +/- 53.3 mg/dL vs 190.5 +/- 42.5 mg/dL (p = NS); for women 196.8 +/- 40 mg/dL vs 187.6 +/- 37.8 mg/dL (p = 0.008, 95% CI 2.4 a 15.9).

Is the dynactin complex required for cleavage plane specification in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos?,"During metazoan development, cell diversity arises primarily from asymmetric cell divisions which are executed in two phases: segregation of cytoplasmic factors and positioning of the mitotic spindle - and hence the cleavage plane -relative to the axis of segregation. When polarized cells divide, spindle alignment probably occurs through the capture and subsequent shortening of astral microtubules by a site in the cortex. Here, we report that dynactin, the dynein-activator complex, is localized at cortical microtubule attachment sites and is necessary for mitotic spindle alignment in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Using RNA interference techniques, we eliminated expression in early embryos of dnc-1 (the ortholog of the vertebrate gene for p150(Glued)) and dnc-2 (the ortholog of the vertebrate gene for p50/Dynamitin). In both cases, misalignment of mitotic spindles occurred, demonstrating that two components of the dynactin complex, DNC-1 and DNC-2, are necessary to align the spindle.",Dynactin complexes may serve as a tether for dynein at the cortex and allow dynein to produce forces on the astral microtubules required for mitotic spindle alignment.,closed_qa
Do methylation levels of the `` long interspersed nucleotide element-1 '' repetitive sequences predict survival of melanoma patients?,"The prognosis of cutaneous melanoma (CM) differs for patients with identical clinico-pathological stage, and no molecular markers discriminating the prognosis of stage III individuals have been established. Genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation are a common event in cancer. This study aimed to define the prognostic value of genomic DNA methylation levels in stage III CM patients. Overall level of genomic DNA methylation was measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing at three CpG sites (CpG1, CpG2, CpG3) of the Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element-1 (LINE-1) sequences in short-term CM cultures from 42 stage IIIC patients. The impact of LINE-1 methylation on overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Hypomethylation (i.e., methylation below median) at CpG2 and CpG3 sites significantly associated with improved prognosis of CM, CpG3 showing the strongest association. Patients with hypomethylated CpG3 had increased OS (P = 0.01, log-rank = 6.39) by Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Median OS of patients with hypomethylated or hypermethylated CpG3 were 31.9 and 11.5 months, respectively. The 5 year OS for patients with hypomethylated CpG3 was 48% compared to 7% for patients with hypermethylated sequences. Among the variables examined by Cox regression analysis, LINE-1 methylation at CpG2 and CpG3 was the only predictor of OS (Hazard Ratio = 2.63, for hypermethylated CpG3; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.21-5.69; P = 0.01).",LINE-1 methylation is identified as a molecular marker of prognosis for CM patients in stage IIIC.

Is the mucosal adhesion receptor alpha4beta7 integrin selectively increased in lymphocytes stimulated with beta-lactoglobulin in children allergic to cow 's milk?,"It has been shown in mice that the integrin alpha4beta7 directs the migration of memory T cells into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. However, little is known about T-cell homing mechanisms in children with food allergies. We investigated the expression of this and other integrins in children with different manifestations of cow's milk allergy (urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and wheezing). PBMCs were stimulated with beta-lactoglobulin, 1 of the major allergenic proteins in cow's milk, and tetanus toxoid. Integrin expression was studied by flow cytometric analysis after 1 week of culture. We found significantly higher expression of the alpha4beta7 integrin in cells from patients compared with control subjects with no allergies (P =. 005) when beta-lactoglobulin was used to stimulate the cells. alpha4beta7 integrin was also expressed at significantly higher levels in beta-lactoglobulin-stimulated cells than in tetanus toxoid-stimulated cells (P =.005). The alphaEbeta7 and the alpha4beta1 integrins were not upregulated by allergen stimulation. Most alpha4beta7 integrin-expressing cells were identified as CD4(+) T cells.","These results show that alpha4beta7 integrin expression after stimulation with beta-lactoglobulin correlates with the presumptive site of cow's milk sensitization (ie, the gut-associated lymphoid tissue but not with the site of symptoms of cow's milk allergy).",closed_qa
Is relief learning dependent on NMDA receptor activation in the nucleus accumbens?,"Recently, we demonstrated that the nucleus accumbens (NAC) is required for the acquisition and expression of relief memory. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of NMDA receptors within the NAC in relief learning. The NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) was injected into the NAC. The effects of these injections on the acquisition and expression of relief memory, as well as on the reactivity to aversive electric stimuli, were tested. Intra-accumbal AP-5 injections blocked the acquisition but not the expression of relief memory. Furthermore, reactivity to aversive electric stimuli was not affected by the AP-5 injections.",The present data indicate that NMDA-dependent plasticity within the NAC is crucial for the acquisition of relief memory.,closed_qa
"Is the MMP1 rs1799750 2G allele associated with increased low back pain , sciatica , and disability after lumbar disk herniation?","Previous studies indicate that genetic variants in genes encoding proteins like matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes may affect degeneration of the intervertebral disk. One such genetic variant is a single nucleotide polymorphism insertion in the promoter region of the MMP1 gene, that is, the MMP1 rs1799750 2G allele, which increases the MMP1 expression in vitro. In this study, we examined whether the MMP1 rs1799750 2G allele might be associated with disk degeneration and clinical outcome after lumbar disk herniation. A total of 260 patients with lumbar disk herniation and sciatic pain were included in this study and genotyped for the MMP1 rs1799750 2G allele. The present data showed no differences in the frequency of the MMP1 2G allele in patients recently diagnosed with disk herniation compared with pain-free controls. Moreover, in the patients, the MMP1 2G allele was not directly related to the disk degeneration. However, our data demonstrated that the MMP1 2G allele was associated with both pain and disability, that is, increased visual analog scale score, McGill Pain Questionnaire score, and Oswestry Disability Index score. Clearly, the patients homozygous for the 2G allele had more pain and reduced function compared with those carrying the 1G allele.","Our findings suggest that the MMP1 rs1799750 2G/2G genotype may contribute to low back pain, sciatica, and disability after lumbar disk herniation.",closed_qa
Does anti-miR-21 suppress Hepatocellular Carcinoma Growth via Broad Transcriptional Network Deregulation?,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a significant clinical challenge with few therapeutic options available to cancer patients. MicroRNA 21-5p (miR-21) has been shown to be upregulated in HCC, but the contribution of this oncomiR to the maintenance of tumorigenic phenotype in liver cancer remains poorly understood. We have developed potent and specific single-stranded oligonucleotide inhibitors of miR-21 (anti-miRNAs) and used them to interrogate dependency on miR-21 in a panel of liver cancer cell lines. Treatment with anti-miR-21, but not with a mismatch control anti-miRNA, resulted in significant derepression of direct targets of miR-21 and led to loss of viability in the majority of HCC cell lines tested. Robust induction of caspase activity, apoptosis, and necrosis was noted in anti-miR-21-treated HCC cells. Furthermore, ablation of miR-21 activity resulted in inhibition of HCC cell migration and suppression of clonogenic growth. To better understand the consequences of miR-21 suppression, global gene expression profiling was performed on anti-miR-21-treated liver cancer cells, which revealed striking enrichment in miR-21 target genes and deregulation of multiple growth-promoting pathways. Finally, in vivo dependency on miR-21 was observed in two separate HCC tumor xenograft models. In summary, these data establish a clear role for miR-21 in the maintenance of tumorigenic phenotype in HCC in vitro and in vivo.",miR-21 is important for the maintenance of the tumorigenic phenotype of HCC and represents a target for pharmacologic intervention.,closed_qa
Is subclinical atherosclerosis increased in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria evaluated by intima-media thickness and pulse wave velocity?,"Microalbuminuria appears to be a risk marker for atherosclerosis. However, little is known about the direct association between microalbuminuria and vascular wall properties. Subjects were 306 type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (N= 200) and microalbuminuria (N= 106). Those who had macroalbuminuria, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and/or ankle brachial index being less than 0.9 were not included. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by automatic oscillometric method. Intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery was measured using high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography and a computerized image-analyzing system. Average IMT, maximum IMT, and PWV were significantly higher in patients with microalbuminuria than in patients with normoalbuminuria. Both average and maximum IMT increased significantly as albuminuria increased in the microalbuminuric range. Average IMT and maximum IMT correlated significantly with PWV (P < 0.0001), although some patients exhibited increased levels of only PWV or IMT. By a multiple linear regression, age and albuminuria were independent predictors of IMT and PWV. Waist circumference was an independent predictor of IMT. Hypertension and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) were independent predictors of PWV. After adjustment for conventional cardiovascular risk factors including age, sex, waist circumference, HbA(1c), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, albuminuria revealed a significant association with average IMT, maximum IMT, and PWV (P < 0.05, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.05, respectively).",A slight elevation of albuminuria is a significant determinant of IMT and PWV independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetic patients with no clinical nephropathy or any vascular diseases.

Are overall and within-food group diversity associated with dietary quality in Belgium?,"To assess the relationship(s) between overall and within-food group diversity and several indices of dietary quality, such as dietary adequacy, moderation and balance, in Belgian adults. Dietary quality indices were derived from the food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG). Information on food intake was collected with two 24 h recalls. Average overall and within-food group diversity scores and dietary adequacy, moderation and balance scores were calculated. A representative sample (n 3245) of the Belgian population at the age of 15 years and older was randomly selected from the National Register using a multistage stratified procedure. For both men and women, total dietary diversity score increased with age and smokers had a significantly lower overall diversity score than non- or former smokers. A positive association was found between overall dietary diversity and both dietary adequacy and balance. For most food groups, especially bread and cereals, vegetables, dairy products and spreadable fats, within-food group dietary diversity was positively associated with the fulfillment of the specific recommendation for the intake of that food group. An inverse association was found between dietary diversity within the meat and the energy-dense, nutrient-poor food groups and dietary balance. Diversity within the dairy and spreadable fat group was responsible for the strongest increase in overall dietary adequacy and balance.","Overall dietary diversity is a useful indicator of dietary quality in Belgium. For some food groups, within-food group dietary diversity is a useful indicator of compliance with the specific FBDG for intake of that food group.",closed_qa
Are glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure unchanged by increased sodium intake in atorvastatin-treated healthy men?,"Improved cardiovascular survival during statin treatment might be due to effects in addition to cholesterol lowering. We hypothesize that sodium intake affects renal function and vasoactive hormones in atorvastatin-treated healthy subjects. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study we measured the effect of a moderate change in sodium intake on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure (BP), renal tubular function, plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones and urinary excretion of aquaporin-2 (u-AQP2) in 22 healthy subjects. The subjects were randomized to standardized fluid intake and diet corresponding to the need for calories in the 4 days before each of the 2 examination days. In one of the periods they were randomized to receive sodium chloride tablets (2 g) thrice daily for 4 days. Two doses of atorvastatin (80 mg) were given; one at 2200 h the evening before the study day, the other at 0830 h in the morning. 24-h urinary sodium excretion increased by 23%. GFR and BP were unchanged. Sodium clearance, fractional excretion of sodium and u-AQP2 increased, whereas free water clearance decreased during high sodium intake. PRC and aldosterone were suppressed during the high sodium diet.","A change in dietary sodium intake of approximately 100 mmol daily does not change GFR and BP in atorvastatin-treated healthy men. The lack of change in BP might reflect that the subjects studied were not sodium sensitive, or that atorvastatin treatment modified sodium sensitivity.",closed_qa
Executive function impairments in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: do they differ between school and home environments?,"The primary purpose of this study was to compare parent and teacher reports of executive function (EF), as measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), on a sample of children who had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). If differences were found, the secondary purpose was to explore these differences by determining which of the 8 BRIEF scales, each representing a different EF, would best predict symptoms of ADHD by the 2 proxy reporters. We performed a secondary data analysis on the assessment information pertaining to 240 children, aged 5 to 15 years, accessing services at an urban Toronto psychiatric program specializing in ADHD. We compared parent and teacher ratings and applied logistical binary regressions to predict the probability of a child's meeting the criteria for clinically significant inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV. As expected, teachers reported more variety and severity of EF impairments than did parents. In addition, teachers used inhibition, organization of materials, and planning and organizing as predictors of ADHD symptoms, whereas parents relied predominantly on inhibition, working memory, and planning and organizing as the risk factors.","Consistent with the current theory, EF impairments, particularly in inhibition, appear to underlie the behavioural manifestation of ADHD. However, parents and teachers do not always agree when reporting EF impairments at home and in school. Thus information from both types of informants is essential for understanding and treating children with this disorder.",closed_qa
Is lower free testosterone level correlated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in asymptomatic middle-aged men with type 2 diabetes mellitus?,"Low testosterone (T) level is associated with cardiovascular risk factors.

A total of 325 men were recruited who had no history, symptoms, or signs of heart disease. T2DM had significantly lower free T (FT) levels than those with normal glucose metabolism (NGM) (428 ± 38 pmol/l vs. 444 ± 38 pmol/l, p = 0.0002), and had an increased risk of LVDD (66.1% vs. 31.8%). There was a significant difference in FT level between subjects with and without LVDD among those with T2DM (421 ± 37 pmol/l vs. 442 ± 40 pmol/l, p = 0.0007), but not among those with NGM (439 ± 37 pmol/l vs. 447 ± 39 pmol/l, p = 0.247) or in the group overall (426 ± 38 pmol/l vs. 445 ± 38 pmol/l, p = 0.156). Lower FT level was significantly associated with LVDD [univariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.63, p = 0.032; multivariate OR = 0.71, p = 0.039]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the usefulness of FT level for predicting LVDD showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 for T2DM (p < 0.001) and 0.66 for NGM (p < 0.05). FT level had a high predictive value for LVDD in T2DM (83% for FT < 414 pmol/l), but a low predictive value in NGM (61% for FT < 423 pmol/l). Comparison of the AUCs showed that FT level was more strongly correlated with LVDD in T2DM than in NGM.",Lower FT level is correlated with LVDD in asymptomatic middle-aged men with T2DM.,closed_qa
Do preterm male infants need more initial respiratory and circulatory support than female infants?,"The aim of this study was to investigate possible gender-related differences in clinical parameters during the first week of life that could explain the higher morbidity and mortality of preterm male infants. In total, 130 clinical variables were collected from 236 inborn infants (130 male and 106 female infants) with gestational age (GA) < 29 wk. A subgroup of 175 extremely low birthweight infants (ELBW) < 1000 g (n = 86 males; n = 89 females) was analysed separately. At 6 postnatal h, 60.8% of the male infants needed mechanical ventilation versus 46.2% of the females (p = 0.026). Chronic lung disease (CLD) developed in 36.2% of males versus 9.8% of female infants (p = 0.004). Inotrope support with dopamine was used in more than 50% of the infants; additional inotrope support to dopamine was needed by 19.4% of male and 9.7% of female infants (p = 0.041). The gender-related difference in need for inotrope support was more evident among the ELBW infants; 67.1% of male infants needed inotrope support versus 50.6% of females (p = 0.028). At 12-24 h, male ELBW infants had lower minimum mean arterial blood pressure (mean (SD) 25(4) mmHg vs 28(6) mmHg, p = 0.004)) and lower minimum PaCO2 than females infants (4.3 (1.1) kPa vs 4.7 (0.9) kPa, p = 0.043).",There are early gender-related differences in need for ventilatory and circulatory support that may contribute to the worse long-term outcome in prematurely born male infants.,closed_qa
Do baicalein protect pancreatic injury in rats with severe acute pancreatitis by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines expression?,"Inflammatory cytokines is a key point in the development of pathogenesis of SAP. Inflammatory mediators TNF-α and IL-6 are up-regulated in serum of patients with SAP and become good discriminators of SAP severity. In this study, we investigated the treatment effectiveness of Baicalein on SAP rat model. Baicalein was intravenously injected immediately after SAP induction in rats. The mortality, histopathology score, ascites fluid volume, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production were evaluated at 12 h after SAP induction. Baicalein decreased the pancreatic histopathology score, reduced ascites fluid production, protected against pancreatic injury, and improved survival in rats with SAP. The serum IL-6 and TNF-α concentrations were also down-regulated by Baicalein.",Baicalein demonstrated a well curative capability on rats with SAP.

Do effects of verb familiarity on finiteness marking in children with specific language impairment?,"Children with specific language impairment (SLI) have known deficits in the verb lexicon and finiteness marking. This study investigated a potential relationship between these 2 variables in children with SLI and 2 control groups considering predictions from 2 different theoretical perspectives, morphosyntactic versus morphophonological. Children with SLI, age-equivalent, and language-equivalent (LE) control children (n=59) completed an experimental sentence imitation task that generated estimates of children's finiteness accuracy under 2 levels of verb familiarity--familiar real verbs versus unfamiliar real verbs--in clausal sites marked for finiteness. Imitations were coded and analyzed for overall accuracy as well as finiteness marking and verb root imitation accuracy. Statistical comparisons revealed that children with SLI did not differ from LE children and were less accurate than age-equivalent children on all dependent variables: overall imitation, finiteness marking imitation, and verb root imitation accuracy. A significant Group×Condition interaction for finiteness marking revealed lower levels of accuracy on unfamiliar verbs for the SLI and LE groups only.","Findings indicate a relationship between verb familiarity and finiteness marking in children with SLI and younger controls and help clarify the roles of morphosyntax, verb lexicon, and morphophonology.",closed_qa
The risk of bacteria in foam sclerotherapy: does the condition of the air in outpatient vs. operating rooms make a difference?,"Foam sclerotherapy has been one of the most frequently applied therapeutic methods for the treatment of varicose veins and venous malformation. Few studies have investigated the sterile condition of the air used for foam creation. To evaluate the bacterial conditions in foam created from the air in outpatient and operating rooms used for sclerotherapy treatment, in order to provide the basis for clinical applications in foam sclerotherapy. In this study, we measured the amount of airborne microorganisms in the air in the operating room, and in the outpatient room, the polidocanol (POL) foam created using the air in the respective rooms, and the microorganisms present in the liquid POL. We used the settle plate method for air sampling. We used the Tessari method to generate foam. The experiment was repeated three times. Typical bacterial colonies were formed on nutrient agar plates in both the outpatient room and operating room air groups. No colonies were cultivated in the liquid POL. Although the use of sterile or nonsterile air in sclerotherapy produces significantly different results in the counts of colony-forming units, there was no difference in the foam created using sterile or nonsterile air (i.e. no colonies were cultivated on either foam).",There is no increased risk of infection when using foam sclerotherapy in outpatient rooms compared with using foam created under sterile operating-room conditions.,closed_qa
Is expression level of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase associated with clinical outcome in patients with T1G3 bladder cancer treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin?,"Recently, it has been shown that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with a strong dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor elicits a significant response in bladder cancer with a high level of DPD. However, only a few studies investigated the association between the level of the enzyme that regulates the metabolism of 5-FU and prognosis in bladder cancer. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there has also been no such report in T1G3 bladder tumors treated with BCG. Therefore, we evaluated enzymes that regulate the metabolism of 5-FU in T1G3 tumors treated with BCG immunotherapy using the Danenberg tumor profile (DTP) method, a highly accurate measurement of RNA from paraffin-embedded specimens. This study included 28 patients with T1G3 bladder cancer, each of whom underwent complete transurethral tumor resection and BCG intravesical instillation at our institution. The median follow-up period was 39 months (range, 3 to 159 months). The DTP method was used to analyze the mRNA expression of 3 enzymes related to 5-FU: DPD, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), and thymidylate synthase (TS). Among the 28 patients, 13 developed recurrences (46.4%) and 5 experienced disease progression (17.9%). An elevated DPD mRNA level was significantly associated with recurrence (p = 0.048) and progression (p = 0.045). However, TS and OPRT mRNA levels were not significantly associated with any other clinical features or outcomes. Furthermore, the high DPD group had a significantly lower recurrence-free survival rate than the low DPD group (p = 0.047). Among patients with low DPD, the 2- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 88.9% and 74.1%, respectively; while among patients with high DPD, the corresponding rates were 61.3% and 36.8%, respectively. TS and OPRT were not significantly associated with recurrence-free survival rates.",DPD is significantly associated with recurrence and progression among T1G3 bladder cancer patients treated with BCG.,closed_qa
Does sexual dimorphism in superantigen shock involve elevated TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha induced hepatic apoptosis?,"There is conflicting evidence regarding sex differences in the outcome from severe sepsis and toxic shock. Superantigen-mediated toxic shock affects a higher proportion of female patients. The objective of the current study was to investigate sexual dimorphism in superantigen-associated sepsis and in superantigen-mediated shock and to identify the key mechanisms responsible for this sex difference. We measured mortality and serum cytokines after induction of sepsis with isogenic superantigen-positive and superantigen-negative Streptococcus pyogenes in HLA class II transgenics. During superantigen-mediated toxic shock, we measured mortality, T-cell responses, systemic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and TNF receptors, TNF-alpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis, and conditioning of these responses by tamoxifen treatment. In both superantigen-associated sepsis and in superantigen-mediated shock, serum TNF-alpha was increased in females compared with males. This was not attributable to a detectable difference in splenic TNF-alpha transcription; rather, serum soluble TNF receptors were higher in males. Pretreatment of females with the estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen increased serum soluble TNF receptors, reduced the early serum TNF-alpha response, and improved mortality in females challenged with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Lethal superantigen shock was characterized by hepatocyte apoptosis, and was reproduced by injection of TNF-alpha. Females had enhanced susceptibility to TNF-alpha-mediated lethality. TNF-alpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was greater in females, and was reduced by tamoxifen pretreatment.","Sexual dimorphism in experimental superantigen toxic shock results from increased systemic TNF-alpha in females, coupled with an increased susceptibility to TNF-alpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. Both processes are abrogated by estrogen receptor modulators.",closed_qa
Does a Novel Nonanchoring Technique for Implantation of Paddle lead in the Cervical Spine Under Conscious Sedation?,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) revision surgery remains common, with a negative impact on cost-effectiveness and outcomes. The primary goal of this report was to retrospectively study the need for revision surgery in a cohort of complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-1) patients with newly implanted cervical surgical paddle leads, focusing on a method of implantation to reduce the need for revision surgery. Fifteen patients underwent implantation of paddle SCS leads in the cervical spine with cervical laminotomies under conscious sedation for CRPS-1 from 2008 to 2012. Electrodes were not anchored and 11 of the electrodes were three-column paddle leads. A disinterested third party performed initial chart reviews, supplemented by subsequent telephone interviews. The need for revision surgery was the endpoint. A single surgeon performed all implants with a consistent method. There were no paddle electrode lead revisions required for suboptimal lead placement, fracture, migration, or infection at a median follow-up period of 22 months.",This study is the first to report on: 1) cervical electrode implantation with no anchoring; and 2) cervical paddle lead implantation (including three-column paddles) performed under conscious sedation. The specific method of nonanchoring of the paddle implants under conscious sedation may have contributed to low electrode lead revision rates.,closed_qa
Do hMG-CoA reductase inhibitors regulate inflammatory transcription factors in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells?,"Pleiotropic atheroprotective effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may be mediated on the level of vascular gene transcription. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of statins on the activation of transcription factors known to regulate inflammation and cell proliferation/differentiation. Simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin (0.1 to 10 micro mol/L) inhibited the binding of nuclear proteins to both the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA consensus oligonucleotides in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The inhibitory effects of statins on NF-kappaB or AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity were examined by transient transfection studies. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors upregulated IkappaB-alpha protein levels in endothelial cells and decreased c-Jun mRNA expression in smooth muscle cells as analyzed by Western and Northern blotting, respectively. Furthermore, statins inhibited DNA binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. Downstream effects of statins included inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A mRNA levels in endothelial cells.","HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors downregulate the activation of transcription factors NF-kappaB, AP-1, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. These findings support the concept that statins have antiinflammatory and antiproliferative effects that are relevant in the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases.",closed_qa
Does hydrocortisone replacement dosage influence intraocular pressure in patients with primary and secondary hypocortisolism?,"It has been suggested that the variation of intraocular pressure (IOP) during the day follows the diurnal variation of serum cortisol. There is also a higher risk of ocular hypertension and glaucoma in patients taking excessive oral steroid treatment. We assessed whether different replacement doses of hydrocortisone (HC) influenced IOP. Seventeen patients (six Addison's disease, 11 hypopituitarism; seven males) aged 24-58 years mean 42.7 years and 20 control subjects (nine males) aged 20--59 years mean 38.7 years were studied. On the first visit, the 17 patients had been taking HC replacement doses, 20 mg morning and 10 mg afternoon. Serum cortisol and IOP in both eyes (Goldmann applanation tonometer) were measured at 0900, 1100, 1300, 1500, 1700 hours with HC 20 mg taken after the 0900 h assessment. The dose of HC was then reduced to 10 mg morning and 10 mg afternoon for 1 week and the measurements were repeated in 16 patients, with HC 10 mg taken at 0900 h. In the patients the peak serum cortisol occurred at 1100 h after the 0900 h HC dose. Cortisol levels were significantly higher at 1100, 1300, 1500 and 1700 h after taking 20 mg compared to 10 mg HC. The mean (SEM) IOP (mmHg) was significantly higher after 20 mg HC compared with 10 mg HC at 1300 h: 14.7(0.6) v 13.1(0.6) (P = 0.004) and at 1500 h: 14.4(0.6) v 13.1(0.5) (P = 0.04). The total mean (SEM) daily IOP score was significantly higher after 20 mg HC compared with 10 mg HC: 14.5(0.3) v 13.5(0.3) (P = 0.0002). The total mean (SEM) daily IOP score after the 20 mg HC dose compared with the control subjects was: 14.5(0.3) v 13.7(0.3) (P = 0.08).",Intraocular pressures during the day are influenced by the morning hydrocortisone replacement dosage with significantly higher intraocular pressure levels in the early afternoon following 20 mg compared with 10 mg. A morning hydrocortisone dose of 10 mg leads to a more physiological intraocular pressure profile during the day. These data support the view that a daily replacement dose of 30 mg hydrocortisone may be excessive.,closed_qa
Does cyclophilin A promote cardiac hypertrophy in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice?,"Cyclophilin A (CyPA, encoded by Ppia) is a proinflammatory protein secreted in response to oxidative stress in mice and humans. We recently demonstrated that CyPA increased angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the aortas of apolipoprotein E (Apoe)-/- mice. In this study, we sought to evaluate the role of CyPA in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was not significantly different between Ppia+/+ and Ppia-/- mice infused with Ang II (1000 ng/min per kg for 4 weeks). Therefore, we investigated the effect of CyPA under conditions of high ROS and inflammation using the Apoe-/- mice. In contrast to Apoe-/- mice, Apoe-/-Ppia-/- mice exhibited significantly less Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Bone marrow cell transplantation showed that CyPA in cells intrinsic to the heart plays an important role in the cardiac hypertrophic response. Ang II-induced ROS production, cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and cardiac fibroblast migration were markedly decreased in Apoe-/-Ppia-/- cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, CyPA directly induced the hypertrophy of cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes.","CyPA is required for Ang II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy by directly potentiating ROS production, stimulating the proliferation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts, and promoting cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.",closed_qa
Do circulating tumor cells count predicts survival in colorectal cancer patients?,"Data on the potential of circulating tumor cells (CTC) count in predicting overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer are timely and worthy of interest. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of CTC count in both localized and metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Consecutive patients with histological diagnosis of colorectal cancer were enrolled. CTC count was performed, by using a quantitative immunofluorescence method, at baseline (T0) and 1 month following start of chemotherapy (T1). A CTC count <2 was considered negative, whilst a CTC level >/= 2 was positive. Overall survival was calculated accordingly. A total of 75 colorectal cancer patients were enrolled, including 54 stages I-III and 21 stage IV patients. Overall, 21 (28%) patients had a positive CTC count at baseline, and it was significantly associated with a worse prognosis as compared to a negative status (OS: 36.2 vs. 61.6 months; P = 0.002). CTC count remained positive after chemotherapy in 22.4% of the patients and it was an independent prognostic factor of OS (P = 0.03; Hazard Ratio: 3.55; 95% CI: 1.1-11.5).",This study found that the presence of CTCs is associated with a reduced survival in colorectal cancer patients.

Does ulinastatin improve pulmonary function in severe burn-induced acute lung injury by attenuating inflammatory response?,"Acute systemic inflammatory response to severe skin burn injury mediates burn-induced acute lung injury. Ulinastatin is potentially an effective intervention, because it attenuates the systemic inflammatory response induced by endotoxin and improves myocardial function during ischemic shock and reperfusion. Rats received full-thickness burn wounds to 30% total body surface area followed by delayed resuscitation. The treatment group received 50,000 U/kg of ulinastatin and the burn group was given vehicle only. A sham group was not burned but otherwise was treated identically. After killing, blood and lung samples were harvested for histology and measurement of inflammatory mediators. Administration of ulinastatin significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1β, -6, and -8 both locally and systemically in burn-injured rats. The secretion of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase in the lung and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on the surface of lung epithelium were inhibited by ulinastatin. Ulinastatin also reduced the increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability. Consistent with these findings, ulinastatin ameliorated the lung edema and pulmonary oxygenation in burn-injured rats.","These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of ulinastatin on inflammatory mediator production, neutrophil activation, and microvascular permeability are associated with the recovery of pulmonary functions in severe burn-induced acute lung injury and suggest that ulinastatin may serve as a potential therapeutic administration in critical burn care.",closed_qa
Does the genetic ablation of cyclooxygenase 2 prevent the development of autoimmune arthritis?,"To determine the effects of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2 gene deletion on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Mice that were susceptible to CIA but lacked either the COX-1 or the COX-2 gene were immunized with type II collagen (CII), and the incidence and severity of arthritis were compared with findings in wild-type animals, by clinical and histologic examination. The immune response was assessed by measuring total CII IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 antibody production in sera from immunized mice. The passive transfer of arthritis, accomplished using anti-CII monoclonal antibodies, was tested in wild-type and COX-deficient (-/-) mice. Splenocytes cultured from CII-immunized wild-type and COX-/- mice were challenged with bovine alpha1(II), and cytokine production was assessed. COX-2 gene deletion reduced the incidence and severity of CIA compared with findings in wild-type and COX-1-/- mice. Histologic examination of joints after the onset of clinical arthritis revealed cartilage erosions, proliferation of the synovial lining, and inflammatory cell infiltration in wild-type and COX-1-/- mice, but not in COX-2-/- mice. COX-2-/- mice exhibited reduced anti-CII IgG antibody levels, indicating a decreased immune response. However, cytokine production by spleen cells from immunized mice indicated no cytokine deficiencies in COX-2-/- mice compared with wild-type or COX-1-/- mice. More important, arthritis could not be passively transferred to naive COX-2-/- mice, indicating a requirement for COX-2 in the pathogenesis of arthritis, independent of the immune response.","COX-2-/- mice exhibit at least 2 defects resulting in down-modulation of the development of CIA: a reduced immune response to CII demonstrated by a markedly reduced antibody titer, and an ""inflammatory"" defect reflected by the inability to passively transfer arthritis to COX-2-/- mice.",closed_qa
Does [ Lung edema follow inspiratory stridor -- another pitfall for the anesthesiologist ]?,"Patients with heart failure or elevated intracranial pressure are at risk of developing lung oedema when anaesthesized. Lung oedema may develop in patients with airway obstructions as well. We refer to a four-year-old boy anaesthesized for elective adenotomia and paracentesis. After being extubated, he developed a moderate inspiratory stridor lasting for hours. Clinically he normalized in two hours on a therapy with oxygen in a mask with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and finally bronchodilator therapy with epinephrine and salbutamol. Successive lung X-rays showed lung oedema almost normalizing in 48 hours.",The triggering mechanism of lung oedema in airway obstruction is the negative intrathoracal pressure generated because of forced inspiratory effort. This pressure is transformed to a negative interstitial hydrostatic pressure that according to Starling's hypothesis on capillary filtration may generate a lung oedema. We conclude that our patient with nasal polyps had a lowered threshold for developing lung oedema faced with postextubatory complications causing inspiratory stridor. Pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.,closed_qa

Do anti-apoptotic treatments prevent cartilage degradation after acute trauma to human ankle cartilage?,"To investigate the effect of anti-apoptotic agents on cartilage degradation after a single impact to ankle cartilage. Ten human normal tali were impacted with the impulse of 1 Ns generating peak forces in the range of 600 N using a 4 mm diameter indenter. Eight millimeter cartilage plugs containing the 4 mm diameter impacted core and a 4 mm adjacent ring were removed and cultured with or without P188 surfactant (8 mg/ml), caspase-3 (10 uM), or caspase-9 (2 uM) inhibitors for 48 h. Results were assessed in the superficial and middle-deep layers immediately after injury at day 0 and at 2, 7 and 14 days after injury by live/dead cell and Tunel assays and by histology with Safranin O/fast green staining. A single impact to human articular cartilage ex vivo resulted in cell death, cartilage degeneration, and radial progression of apoptosis to the areas immediately adjacent to the impact. The P188 was more effective in preventing cell death than the inhibitors of caspases. It reduced cell death by more than 2-fold (P<0.05) in the core and by about 30% in the ring in comparison with the impacted untreated control at all time points. P188 also prevented radial expansion of apoptosis in the ring region especially in the first 7 days post-impaction (7.5% Tunel-positive cells vs 46% in the untreated control; P<0.01). Inhibitors of caspase-3 or -9 were effective in reducing cell death in the impacted core only at early time points, but were ineffective in doing so in the ring.

Are children with both asthma and depression at risk for heightened inflammation?,"To test whether children and adolescents with co-occurring asthma and depression are at risk for elevated inflammation-concurrently and at the next assessment. Up to 6 yearly assessments per person from the prospective, population-based Great Smoky Mountains Study (N = 1420) were used, covering children in the community aged 10-16 years old. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) was assayed from annual bloodspot collections and provided indicators of elevated inflammation at CRP > 1, CRP > 2, and CRP > 3 mg/L. Depression was assessed with the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. Asthma was assessed using a form adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Health Interview Survey. Controlling common covariates of CRP, the co-occurrence of asthma and depression predicted heightened CRP-concurrently and at the next assessment. In turn, elevated CRP was relatively stable from one assessment to the next.","The co-occurrence of asthma and depression in childhood poses a risk for substantially elevated inflammation concurrently and over time, which could contribute to pathophysiological processes involved in the development of additional chronic diseases and also to asthma--related morbidity and mortality.",closed_qa
"Is hIV-induced immune deficiency associated with a higher risk of hepatocarcinoma , ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort , France , 1998-2008?","HIV and viral hepatitis co-infected patients are at high risk for hepatocarcinoma. The contribution of immunodeficiency is not well documented. We aimed at estimating the relationship between the occurrence of hepatocarcinoma and both types of measures of immunodeficiency, current and cumulative (time below a given threshold), to assess their independent effects. HIV-infected adults included in the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort with no history of cancer, ≥ 3 months of follow-up between 1998 and 2008, ≥ 1 CD4+ cell count (CD4+), and documented hepatitis virus status were eligible. Extended Cox proportional hazards models with delayed entry were used to estimate the risk of hepatocarcinoma. Exposure to a CD4+ < 350 or <500 cells/mm(3) (current and cumulative duration) was time-updated. Hepatitis B or C virus co-infection and gender were fixed-effect variables. Sixteen cases of hepatocarcinoma were diagnosed among the 2864 eligible patients, the incidence rate was 0.78 case/1000 person-years (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.40-1.16). Current CD4+ < 350 or < 500 was independently associated with a higher risk of hepatocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 5.0, CI 1.5-16.8, p = 0.009 and HR = 10.3, CI 1.3-82.8, p = 0.029, respectively). The occurrence of hepatocarcinoma was independent of the cumulative exposure to a CD4+ < 350 or < 500 (p = 0.38 or p = 0.80, respectively).","Presenting with CD4+ < 500 was associated with a higher risk of hepatocarcinoma, whereas the cumulative duration with immunodeficiency was not.

Are myeloperoxidase levels associated with carotid atherosclerosis progression in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia?,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO), an antimicrobial enzyme of the innate immune system, has been proposed to exert a wide array of pro-atherogenic effects throughout all stages of the atherosclerotic process. In view of the potent anti-inflammatory effects of statins in vitro, we evaluated the impact of statin therapy on plasma MPO levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), treated with either intensive or conventional lipid-lowering therapy. Furthermore, we evaluated the relation between MPO levels and atherosclerosis progression, as determined by intima media thickness (IMT). We measured plasma MPO levels, lipoprotein profiles, high sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as well as IMT of carotid artery segments in 122 FH patients at baseline and after 2-year treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg or simvastatin 40 mg QD. Baseline median MPO values were 147pM (interquartile range (IQR) 122-217) and 144pM (IQR 118-216) and these increased significantly to 221pM (IQR 144-290) and 255pM (IQR 152-324) during 2-year follow-up in both the atorvastatin 80 mg and simvastatin 40 mg group, respectively.

Does e/N-cadherin switch mediate cancer progression via TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma?,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental process governing not only morphogenesis in multicellular organisms, but also cancer progression. During EMT, epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is downregulated while neural cadherin (N-cadherin) is upregulated, referred to as 'cadherin switch'. This study aimed to investigate whether cadherin switch promotes cancer progression in cholangiocarcinoma (CC). CC cell lines were examined for migration, invasion, and morphological changes with typical EMT-induced model using recombinant TGF-β1. The changes in E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression were investigated during EMT. We also examined E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression in resected specimens from extrahepatic CC patients (n=38), and the associations with clinicopathological factors and survival rates. TGF-β1 treatment activated cell migration, invasion, and fibroblastic morphological changes, especially in extrahepatic CC HuCCT-1 cells. These changes occurred with E-cadherin downregulation and N-cadherin upregulation, that is, cadherin switch.

Is serum type IV collagen level predictive for esophageal varices in patients with severe alcoholic disease?,To determine factors predictive for esophageal varices in severe alcoholic disease (SAD). Abdominal ultrasonography (US) was performed on 444 patients suffering from alcoholism. Forty-four patients found to have splenomegaly and/ or withering of the right liver lobe were defined as those with SAD. SAD patients were examined by upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy for the presence of esophageal varices. The existence of esophageal varices was then related to clinical variables. Twenty-five patients (56.8%) had esophageal varices. A univariate analysis revealed a significant difference in age and type IV collagen levels between patients with and without esophageal varices. A logistic regression analysis identified type IV collagen as the only independent variable predictive for esophageal varices (P = 0.017). The area under the curve (AUC) for type IV collagen as determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for predicting esophageal varices was 0.78.,This study suggests that the level of type IV collagen has a high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of esophageal varices in SAD.,closed_qa
Does emergency Medical Services Provider Pediatric Adverse Event Rate vary by Call Origin Pediatric Emergency Care?,"Emergency medical services providers may be called to a variety of sites to transport pediatric patients, whether it be a scene call for initial evaluation and care, a clinic for transportation of a patient who has been assessed by medical providers, or a hospital where assessment and stabilization have already begun. We hypothesize that there may be a direct relationship between adverse event rates and adverse event severity in transports from less medically stabilizing origins. Emergency medical services records of all critical pediatric transports in an urban Oregon county in 2011 were reviewed and abstracted using a standardized tool. From this, UNSEMs (unintended injury, near miss, suboptimal action, error, management complication) were determined, and the potential severity of the issue was assessed. Then, UNSEMs were compared with the origin of transport using logistic regression. Four hundred ninety records were abstracted: 59 hospital transports, 48 clinic transports, and 384 scene transports. Furthermore, UNSEMs were noted in 24 hospital transports (40.7%), 33 clinic transports (68.8%), and 263 scene transports (68.5%). Severe UNSEMs were reported on 0 hospital transports (0.0%), 12 clinic transports (25.0%), and 65 scene transports (16.9%). The odds ratio of UNSEM occurrence from a hospital compared with nonmedical scenes was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.60), and the odds ratio of a severe UNSEM from a hospital compared with nonmedical scenes was 0.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.63).","In conclusion, UNSEMs involving the emergency medical services care of children are more likely to occur when transport originates from a clinic or scene compared with a hospital.",closed_qa
Does vacuum frying as a route to produce novel snacks with desired quality attribute according to new health trends?,"Consumers look for products that contribute to their wellness and health, however, even health-conscious consumers are not willing to sacrifice organoleptic properties, and intense full-flavor snacks remain an important trend. The objective of this study was to examine most important quality parameters of vacuum (1.92 inHg) and atmospheric-fried carrot, potato, and apple slices to determine specific advantages of vacuum technology. Slices were fried using equivalent thermal driving forces, maintaining a constant difference between oil temperature and the boiling point of water at the working pressure (ΔT = 60 and 80 °C). This resulted in frying temperatures of 160 and 180 °C, and 98 and 118 °C, for atmospheric and vacuum frying, respectively. Vacuum-fried carrot and potato chips absorbed about 50% less oil than atmospheric-fried chips, whereas vacuum-fried apple chips reduced oil absorption by 25%. Total carotenoids and ascorbic acid (AA) were greatly preserved during vacuum frying. Carrot chips vacuum fried at 98 °C retained about 90% of total carotenoids, whereas potato and apple slices vacuum fried at 98 °C, preserved around 95% of their initial AA content. Interestingly, results showed that the antioxidant capacity of chips may be related to both the presence of natural antioxidants and brown pigments developed at elevated temperatures.","A way to reduce detrimental effects of deep-fat frying is through operating-pressure reduction, the essence behind vacuum deep-fat frying. In this way, it is possible to remove product moisture at a low temperature in a low-oxygen environment. The objective of this research was to study the effect of oil temperature reduction when vacuum frying traditional (potatoes) and nontraditional products (carrots and apples) on most important quality attributes (vitamins, color, and oil uptake). Results are promising and show that vacuum frying can be an alternative to produce nutritious and novel snacks with desired quality attributes, since vitamins and color were greatly preserved and oil absorption could be substantially reduced.",closed_qa
Do prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors increase the production of vascular endothelial growth factor in dental pulp-derived cells?,"Prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors can induce a proangiogenic response that stimulates regeneration in soft and hard tissues. However, the effect of PHD inhibitors on the dental pulp is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of PHD inhibitors on the proangiogenic capacity of human dental pulp-derived cells. To test the response of dental pulp-derived cells to PHD inhibitors, the cells were exposed to dimethyloxalylglycine, desferrioxamine, L-mimosine, and cobalt chloride. To assess the response of dental pulp cells to a capping material supplemented with PHD inhibitors, the cells were treated with supernatants from calcium hydroxide. Viability, proliferation, and protein synthesis were assessed by formazan formation, (3)[H]thymidine, and (3)[H]leucine incorporation assays. The effect on the proangiogenic capacity was measured by immunoassays for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We found that all 4 PHD inhibitors can reduce viability, proliferation, and protein synthesis at high concentrations. At nontoxic concentrations and in the presence of supernatants from calcium hydroxide, PHD inhibitors stimulated the production of VEGF in dental pulp-derived cells. When calcium hydroxide was supplemented with the PHD inhibitors, the supernatants from these preparations did not significantly elevate VEGF levels.","These results show that PHD inhibitors can stimulate VEGF production of dental pulp-derived cells, suggesting a corresponding increase in their proangiogenic capacity. Further studies will be required to understand the impact that this might have on pulp regeneration.",closed_qa
Does early postnatal allopurinol improve short term outcome after severe birth asphyxia?,"To investigate whether postnatal allopurinol would reduce free radical induced reperfusion/reoxygenation injury of the brain in severely asphyxiated neonates.

Do a prospective study of risk for Sturge-Weber syndrome in children with upper facial port-wine stain?,"Upper facial port-wine stain (PWS) is a feature of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). Recent studies suggest that the distribution of the PWS corresponds to genetic mosaicism rather than to trigeminal nerve impairment. We sought to refine the cutaneous distribution of upper facial PWS at risk for SWS. This was a prospective multicenter study of consecutive cases of upper facial PWS larger than 1 cm² located in the ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve distribution in infants aged less than 1 year, seen in 8 French pediatric dermatology departments between 2006 and 2012. Clinical data, magnetic resonance imaging, and photographs were systematically collected and studied. PWS were classified into 6 distinct patterns. In all, 66 patients were included. Eleven presented with SWS (magnetic resonance imaging signs and seizure). Four additional infants had suspected SWS without neurologic manifestations. Hemifacial (odds ratio 7.7, P = .003) and median (odds ratio 17.08, P = .008) PWS patterns were found to be at high risk for SWS. A nonmedian linear pattern was not associated with SWS.",Small number of patients translated to limited power of the study.,closed_qa
Do factors associated with breast cancer worry 3 years after completion of adjuvant treatment?,"Although many survivors continue to worry about cancer years after completing treatment, little is known about factors associated with cancer worry. This study examined associations between breast cancer worry and demographic and clinical variables, as well as fatigue, symptom burden, and risk perception in a sample of breast cancer survivors 3 years post-adjuvant treatment. We hypothesized that after controlling for demographic and treatment factors, a significant proportion of variance in cancer worry would be explained by greater fatigue severity, more symptom burden, and greater perceived risk of recurrence. Stage 0-II breast cancer patients (N = 202) completed measures of risk perception, cancer worry (modified Lerman's Cancer Worry Scale), symptom burden (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale), and fatigue severity (Fatigue Symptom Inventory) 3 years after completing adjuvant treatment. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the proportion of variance in cancer worry accounted for by fatigue, symptom burden, and risk perception after controlling for demographic and clinical variables. Age, fatigue, symptom burden, and risk perception each explained a significant proportion of variance in cancer worry (p < 0.05). Fatigue, symptom burden, and risk perception together accounted for 27% of the variance in cancer worry after controlling for demographic and clinical factors (p < 0.01).","The hypothesis was supported that fatigue, symptom burden, and risk perception are associated with cancer worry among breast cancer survivors. It is possible that lingering fatigue and other symptoms may remind breast cancer survivors of their disease.",closed_qa
Does s100B serum level predict computed tomography findings after minor head injury?,"Mild head injury (MHI) implies a risk for traumatic brain injury and even a small risk for development of an intracranial hematoma. Head computed tomography (CT) is recommended for early detection of such pathologic findings. The present multicenter study was performed to investigate whether determination of protein S100B in serum could contribute to the selection of patients for CT scanning. We included 226 patients with a history of head injury and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15 at admission to hospital. Blood samples for S100B analysis and head CT were obtained within 12 hours after the injury. The diagnostic properties of S100B measurements for prediction of intracranial injury revealed by CT were tested with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and cross-table analysis at different cut-off levels. We also included analysis of S100B levels normalized to correspond to blood sampling 1 hour after the injury. CT showed intracranial injury in 21 (9.3%) patients. S100B levels were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated in patients with intracranial injury (mean, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21-0.50 microg/L) compared with those in patients without intracranial injury (mean, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.16-0.20 microg/L). ROC curve analysis showed a significant (p = 0.001) area under the curve (0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84). Cross-table analysis showed that 20 of 21 (sensitivity 0.95) patients with intracranial injury were detected at a cut-off level of 0.10 microg/L, but 141 of 205 (specificity 0.31) patients with no such injury also had a S100B level above this limit. Exclusion of cases with blood samples collected more than 3 hours after injury or normalization did not improve the diagnostic properties.","Determination of serum S100B cannot replace the clinical examination or use of CT for patients with minor head injury, but adding S100B measurement to the clinical evaluation might support selection of patients for CT scanning.",closed_qa
Total Artificial Heart and Chronic Haemodialysis: A Possible Bridge to Transplantation?,"Total artificial heart (TAH) device is sometimes necessary to treat end stage heart failure (HF). After surgery, renal impairment can occur with the need of renal replacement therapy. We report the case of a 51-year-old man who was treated with conventional hemodialysis (HD) while on support with TAH. The patient underwent HD while on TAH support during 14 months. He benefited from conventional HD, 6 sessions per week. HD sessions were well tolerated, and patient's condition and quality of life improved significantly. The main difficulty was to maintain red blood cell level because of chronic hemolysis due to TAH, which required repetitive blood transfusions, resulting in a high rate of human leukocyte antigen sensitization. Unfortunately, the patient died of mesenteric ischemia due to anticoagulation under dosing.",We conclude that HD treatment is possible despite TAH and should be considered in patients with both end stage renal and HF.,closed_qa
Is helicobacter pylori gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase a pathogenic factor in the development of peptic ulcer disease?,"gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) has been reported to be a virulence factor of Helicobacter pylori associated with bacterial colonization and cell apoptosis. But its mechanism of pathogenesis is not firmly established. This study aims to examine its role in H pylori-mediated infection. Various H pylori isogenic mutants were constructed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach. H pylori native GGT protein (HP-nGGT) was purified with ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Generation of H2O2 was measured with fluorimetric analysis, whereas nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation was determined by luciferase assay and Western blot. Cytokine production was examined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and real-time PCR. DNA damage was assessed with comet assay and flow cytometry. The GGT activity of 98 H pylori isolates was analyzed by an enzymatic assay. Purified HP-nGGT generated H2O2 in primary gastric epithelial cells and AGS gastric cancer cells, resulting in the activation of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) production. In addition, HP-nGGT caused an increase in the level of 8-OH-dG, indicative of oxidative DNA damage. In contrast, Deltaggt showed significantly reduced levels of H2O2 generation, IL-8 production, and DNA damage in cells compared with the wild type (P<.05). The clinical importance of GGT was indicated by significantly higher (P<.001) activity in H pylori isolates obtained from patients with peptic ulcer disease (n=54) than isolates from patients with nonulcer dyspepsia (n=44).",Our findings provide evidence that GGT is a pathogenic factor associated with H pylori-induced peptic ulcer disease.,closed_qa
Is recovery rate of adrenal function after surgery in patients with acromegaly higher than in those with non-functioning pituitary tumors : a large single center study?,"To compare hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis integrity at diagnosis and recovery after transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), in acromegaly patients, compared with tumor size matched non-functioning adenoma (NFA) patients. A retrospective 7-year evaluation of acromegaly patients, who underwent TSS with 52 weeks follow-up at a single institution, was undertaken. 50 acromegaly with complete follow-up data at all points and 50 NFA patients were matched for tumor size; HPA axis was similarly assessed pre-operatively and at 6, 12 and 52 weeks post-operatively. Recovery of HPA axis and gender specific prevalence of adrenal insufficiency (AI), were analyzed in both groups. We also studied AI in acromegaly patients requiring medical therapy post-operatively vs those in remission after surgery. AI remained less prevalent in acromegaly vs NFA (acromegaly, p = 0.01; NFA, p = 0.15) at 52 weeks after surgery, although the prevalence of AI decreased in both groups from baseline by 52 weeks. Additionally, recovery from baseline AI was significantly greater by 52 weeks in acromegaly patients over NFA patients (p = 0.001). Recovery of HPA axis in acromegaly patients remained significant (p = 0.03) despite the need for medical therapy. AI at baseline was proportionately more prevalent in acromegalic males at baseline (p = 0.002) but no gender difference was apparent at 52 weeks (p = 0.35). Conversely, in NFA patients, no gender difference was apparent pre-operatively (p = 0.49), but AI was more prevalent in males at 52 weeks (p = 0.001).","In the longest comparative study to date using a standard assessment modality, HPA axis recovery was more frequent in acromegaly compared to NFA patients, independent of tumor size, cavernous sinus invasion (CSI), and body mass index (BMI). HPA axis integrity must be carefully and periodically monitored in acromegaly patients during short- and long-term follow-up to prevent overtreatment with glucocorticoids.",closed_qa
Is cleavage of endometrial α-integrins into their functional forms mediated by proprotein convertase 5/6?,"Proprotein convertases (PCs) post-translationally activate a large number of protein precursors through limited cleavage. PC5/6 (PC6) in the human endometrium is tightly regulated during receptivity for embryo implantation. Integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins, some of which play an important role in the adhesive interactions between the trophoblast (blastocyst) and uterine epithelium at implantation. Integrins require PC cleavage for post-translational modification. We hypothesize that pro-integrin-αs in the endometrial epithelium are post-translationally cleaved by PC6 into functional subunits for the binding of blastocyst and adhesion of extracellular matrix proteins. We first used the endometrial epithelial cell line, HEC1A, into which siRNA specific to human PC6 (PC6-siRNA) or scrambled sequence (control) was stably transfected. The specific knockdown was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. PC6-siRNA cells reduced their capacity to attach to trophoblast spheroids and bind to fibronectin compared with control. Knockdown of PC6 decreased cell surface presentation of functional integrins-α1, α2, α5, αV and αVβ5. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PC6 was responsible for the post-translational cleavage of pro-integrin-α5 and integrin-αV into their heavy and light chains in HEC1A cells. We then isolated primary human endometrial epithelial cells and validated that PC6 mediated the post-translational cleavage of integrin-αs in these cells.","This study implicates PC6 as a key regulatory protein essential for the attachment of the blastocyst to the endometrial epithelium through the processing of pro-integrin-αs. Compromised PC6 action reduces the post-translational modification of integrin-αs, thus compromising implantation.",closed_qa

Are pulmonary resections following prior definitive chemoradiation therapy associated with acceptable survival?,"The benefits of salvage resection for lung cancer recurrence following high-dose curative-intent chemoradiation therapy are unclear. We assessed survival after salvage lung resection following definitive chemoradiation. Medical records of patients undergoing lung cancer resections at our institution following definitive chemoradiation therapy were reviewed from June 2006 to August 2012. A multivariate Cox proportional model was used to assess the factors associated with improved survival. Fourteen patients had chemoradiation therapy before lung resection (pneumonectomy, lobectomy or segmentectomy). Pretherapy cancer stage was Stage III in 11 patients, Stage IV in 2 and Stage II in 1. Postoperative 2-year survival was 49%. Patients had a median disease-free interval before resection of 33 months. No variables were found to be associated with improved post-chemoradiation survival from the time of definitive treatment or postoperative survival. Complications occurred in 6 (43%) patients, with 2 of those complications directly attributable to post-chemoradiation changes.

Is preoperative testing inconsistent with published guidelines and rarely changes management?,"The Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS), the Ontario Preoperative Task Force (OPTF) and The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) have published guidelines detailing the indications for preoperative testing. The purpose of this study was to: (a) document compliance of testing practice at TOH-Civic Campus with published guidelines; and (b) determine the impact of preoperative testing on clinical management. Following Research Ethics approval all patients undergoing elective surgery at TOH-Civic Campus in the first three months of 2004 were identified. One hundred charts from each month were randomly selected and analyzed retrospectively by a single reviewer. The ordering and results of four preoperative tests were characterized. The indication for preoperative testing was identified from preoperative notes and the source of non-compliant orders was identified. Compliance with the CAS, OPTF, and TOH guidelines was documented. Abnormal test results were analyzed for evidence of a subsequent change in clinical management. The charts of 294 of the 2,116 patients who underwent elective surgery at TOH-Civic Campus in the first three months of 2004 were reviewed. A total of 534 tests were ordered on 198 patients (67%).

Does platelet inhibition reduce cyclic flow variations and neointimal proliferation in normal and hypercholesterolemic-atherosclerotic canine coronary arteries?,"Platelet-derived growth factors help stimulate the neointimal proliferation of restenosis after coronary interventions. Reducing platelet accumulation at treated sites may attenuate restenosis. We tested this hypothesis by inducing repetitive platelet aggregation at coronary angioplasty sites in dogs and measuring subsequent neointima formation. Cholesterol-sensitive dogs (n=74) received either 4% cholesterol-enriched diets for >8 months (n=29), creating visible atheromas, or normal canine diets (n=45). A coronary balloon angioplasty cyclic flow variation (CFV) model was used. One group of control dogs (group 1, n=8) had angioplasty with no arterial constriction applied and no drug treatment. Three other groups had arterial constrictors applied to provoke CFVs: group 2 (n=28) received no drug therapy, group 3 (n=18) received oral aspirin alone, and group 4 (n=20) received 3 oral antiplatelet agents: ridogrel, ketanserin, and clopidogrel (R+K+C) to simultaneously inhibit the thromboxane A(2), serotonin, and ADP pathways of platelet aggregation, respectively. Bleeding times were moderately prolonged in the aspirin-treated group (124+/-9 seconds after 3 weeks versus 76+/-6 seconds at baseline, P<0.01) and greatly prolonged on R+K+C (>600 versus 104+/-5 seconds, P<0.001). The frequency and severity of CFVs were inversely related to the degree of platelet inhibition and prolongation of bleeding times, as was sudden death due to acute thrombotic coronary occlusion. Quantitative histology at 8 weeks revealed increased intima-to-media ratio with CFVs: 0.89+/-0.14 in the untreated group 2 versus 0.11+/-0.04 in the control group (P<0.001). Intima-to-media ratio was significantly reduced with antiplatelet treatment (0.27+/-0.05 with aspirin treatment and 0.20+/-0.05 with R+K+C treatment, respectively, P<0.001). Cholesterol feeding did not appear to influence results.","Repetitive platelet accumulation at coronary angioplasty sites caused enhanced neointimal proliferation by 8 weeks. Oral inhibitors of platelet aggregation attenuated platelet function, prolonged bleeding times, reduced or prevented cyclic flows and abrupt thrombotic occlusions, and thereby inhibited neointimal proliferation.

Does pulmonary tuberculosis change with ageing?,"In most low prevalence countries, tuberculosis has become a disease of the aged; it has recently been suggested that the elderly may present a specific pattern. To compare clinical, bacteriological and radiological features of pulmonary tuberculosis between young and elderly populations in a high incidence country. We retrospectively studied 337 consecutive pulmonary tuberculosis patients without confirmed HIV infection, hospitalised from 1989 to 1993. The clinical, bacteriological and radiological features of the two age groups considered, young adults (<60 years) and elderly (>or = 60 years), were compared. Thoracic pain (16.3% vs 32.7%) and fever (27.2% vs 50.6%) were significantly less frequent in the elderly, while the frequency and duration of other symptoms before hospitalisation were similar. After admission, fever remained longer in young patients (P<0.05). No significant differences were found regarding the general health status at hospitalisation, or associated illnesses (83.7% vs 73.5%; P = 0.068).

Is tff3 expressed in neurons and microglial cells?,"The trefoil factor family (TFF) peptide TFF3 is typically secreted by mucous epithelia, but is also expressed in the immune system and the brain. It was the aim of this study to determine the cerebral cell types which express Tff3. Primary cultures from rat embryonic or neonatal cerebral cortex and hippocampus, respectively, were studied by means of RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Moreover, Tff3 expression was localized by immunocytochemistry in sections of adult rat cerebellum. Tff3 transcripts were detectable in neural cultures of both the cortex and the hippocampus as well as in glial cell-enriched cultures. Tff3 peptide co-localized with Map2 indicating an expression in neurons in vitro. The neuronal expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence studies of adult rat cerebellum. Furthermore, Tff3 peptide showed also a clear co-localization with Iba-1 in vitro typical of activated microglial cells.","The neuronal expression of Tff3 is in line with a function of a typical neuropeptide influencing, e.g., fear, memory, depression and motoric skills. The expression in activated microglial cells, which is demonstrated here for the first time, points towards a possible function for Tff3 in immune reactions in the CNS. This opens a plethora of additional possible functions for Tff3 including synaptic plasticity and cognition as well as during neuroinflammatory diseases and psychiatric disorders.",closed_qa
Do phosphorylated osteopontin peptides suppress crystallization by inhibiting the growth of calcium oxalate crystals?,"Osteopontin isolated from human urine [uropontin (uOPN)] is a potent inhibitor of calcium oxalate (CaOx) monohydrate (COM) crystallization. However, specific structural features responsible for its effects on CaOx crystallization were not previously known. The present studies were designed to define molecular features responsible for interactions of uOPN with COM crystals and the inhibition of crystallization. Peptides and phosphopeptides with sequences corresponding to potential crystal binding domains within the protein sequence of osteopontin were synthesized. Then the effects of these peptides on COM crystal growth and crystal aggregation were investigated and their secondary structures analyzed. Growth of COM crystals was inhibited by approximately 50% at 1000 nmol/L concentrations by the two unmodified peptides with the closest clustering of aspartic acid residues. Growth was not inhibited by the other two unmodified peptides, with aspartic residues more evenly distributed within their sequences. Phosphorylation markedly increased inhibition of COM crystal growth, so that each of the four phosphorylated peptides inhibited growth by at least 50% at concentrations of < or =200 nmol/L. Phosphorylation of these peptides did not cause changes in secondary structure that would favor interaction with COM crystal surfaces.","These studies of synthetic peptides identify molecular features within the osteopontin molecule that contribute to the inhibition of one aspect of COM crystallization. The inhibition of crystal growth induced by phosphorylation appears to result from altered local patterns of charge density, since conformational changes favoring interaction with crystals were not caused by phosphorylation.",closed_qa
Do effect of French maritime pine bark extract on endometriosis as compared with leuprorelin acetate?,"To clarify the effect of Pycnogenol (Horphag Research, Geneva, Switzerland), French maritime pine bark extract, on endometriosis. Fifty-eight women were included in this study. They were operated on conservatively for endometriosis and surgically diagnosed with the condition. All patients were followed at 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after starting treatment to check for endometriosis signs and symptoms, including changes in CA-125 and estrogen levels (E2). Thirty-two patients in the Pycnogenol treatment group took 60 mg Pycnogenol orally a day for 48 weeks. The 26 patients who received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (Gn-RHa) were treated in the standard way. Treatment with Pycnogenol slowly but steadily reduced the symptom scores. Treatment with Gn-RHa reduced the scores more efficiently; however, 24 weeks after the end of treatment, the scores suggested a recurrence of signs. No influence of treatment on menstrual cycles or E2 was observed in the Pycnogenol group. CA-125 decreased in both treatment groups. Patients with smaller endometriomas responded better to treatment as compared to patients with larger endometriomas.

Is the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium also a potent inhibitor of cholinesterases and the internal Ca ( 2+ ) pump?,"Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) is often used as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, but is increasingly being found to have unrelated side effects. We investigated its effects on smooth muscle contractions and the related mechanisms. We studied isometric contractions in smooth muscle strips from bovine trachea. Cholinesterase activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay; internal Ca(2+) pump activity was assessed by Ca(2+) uptake into smooth muscle microsomes. Contractions to acetylcholine were markedly enhanced by DPI (10(-4) M), whereas those to carbachol (CCh) were not, suggesting a possible inhibition of cholinesterase. DPI markedly suppressed contractions evoked by CCh, KCl and 5-HT, and also unmasked phasic activity in otherwise sustained responses. Direct biochemical assays confirmed that DPI was a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (IC(50) approximately 8 x 10(-6) M and 6 x 10(-7) M, respectively), following a readily reversible, mixed non-competitive type of inhibition. The inhibitory effects of DPI on CCh contractions were not mimicked by another NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin), nor the Src inhibitors PP1 or PP2, ruling out an action through the NADPH oxidase signalling pathway. Several features of the DPI-mediated suppression of agonist-evoked responses (i.e. suppression of peak magnitudes and unmasking of phasic activity) are similar to those of cyclopiazonic acid, an inhibitor of the internal Ca(2+) pump. Direct measurement of microsomal Ca(2+) uptake revealed that DPI modestly inhibits the internal Ca(2+) pump.",DPI inhibits cholinesterase activity and the internal Ca(2+) pump in tracheal smooth muscle.,closed_qa
Is the cellular distribution of serotonin transporter impeded on serotonin-altered vimentin network?,"The C-terminus of the serotonin transporter (SERT) contains binding domains for different proteins and is critical for its functional expression. In endogenous and heterologous expression systems, our proteomic and biochemical analysis demonstrated that an intermediate filament, vimentin, binds to the C-terminus of SERT. It has been reported that 5HT-stimulation of cells leads to disassembly and spatial reorientation of vimentin filaments. We tested the impact of 5HT-stimulation on vimentin-SERT association and found that 5HT-stimulation accelerates the translocation of SERT from the plasma membrane via enhancing the level of association between phosphovimentin and SERT. Furthermore a progressive truncation of the C-terminus of SERT was performed to map the vimentin-SERT association domain. Deletion of up to 20, but not 14 amino acids arrested the transporters at intracellular locations. Although, truncation of the last 14 amino acids, did not alter 5HT uptake rates of transporter but abolished its association with vimentin. To understand the involvement of 5HT in phosphovimentin-SERT association from the plasma membrane, we further investigated the six amino acids between Delta14 and Delta20, i.e., the SITPET sequence of SERT. While the triple mutation on the possible kinase action sites, S(611), T(613), and T(616) arrested the transporter at intracellular locations, replacing the residues with aspartic acid one at a time altered neither the 5HT uptake rates nor the vimentin association of these mutants. However, replacing the three target sites with alanine, either simultaneously or one at a time, had no significant effect on 5HT uptake rates or the vimentin association with transporter.","Based on our findings, we propose that phosphate modification of the SITPET sequence differentially, one at a time exposes the vimentin binding domain on the C-terminus of SERT. Conversely, following 5HT stimulation, the association between vimentin-SERT is enhanced which changes the cellular distribution of SERT on an altered vimentin network.",closed_qa
Does paracrine Engineering of Human Cardiac Stem Cells With Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 enhance Myocardial Repair?,"Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) activates prosurvival pathways and improves postischemic cardiac function, but this key cytokine is not robustly expressed by cultured human cardiac stem cells. We explored the influence of an enhanced IGF-1 paracrine signature on explant-derived cardiac stem cell-mediated cardiac repair. Receptor profiling demonstrated that IGF-1 receptor expression was increased in the infarct border zones of experimentally infarcted mice by 1 week after myocardial infarction. Human explant-derived cells underwent somatic gene transfer to overexpress human IGF-1 or the green fluorescent protein reporter alone. After culture in hypoxic reduced-serum media, overexpression of IGF-1 enhanced proliferation and expression of prosurvival transcripts and prosurvival proteins and decreased expression of apoptotic markers in both explant-derived cells and cocultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Transplant of explant-derived cells genetically engineered to overexpress IGF-1 into immunodeficient mice 1 week after infarction boosted IGF-1 content within infarcted tissue and long-term engraftment of transplanted cells while reducing apoptosis and long-term myocardial scarring.",Paracrine engineering of explant-derived cells to overexpress IGF-1 provided a targeted means of improving cardiac stem cell-mediated repair by enhancing the long-term survival of transplanted cells and surrounding myocardium.,closed_qa
Is fOXA1 a potential oncogene in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma?,"FOXA1 is a mammalian endodermal transcription factor belonging to the human forkhead box gene family that plays a role in certain tumor types. Here, we investigated the potential role of FOXA1 in human thyroid carcinomas. We examined the level of FOXA1 expression and gene copy number by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively, in a cohort of benign and malignant thyroid tumors. In addition, we examined the role of FOXA1 in the proliferation of an undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line by short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing. We show that FOXA1 is overexpressed in human anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). In addition, we identify FOXA1 DNA copy number gain within the 14q21.1 locus in both an ATC cell line and human ATC cases. Silencing of FOXA1 in an ATC cell line causes G(1) growth arrest and reduction of cell proliferation. Moreover, we observe a potential link between FOXA1 and the cell cycle machinery by identifying p27(kip1) up-regulation on FOXA1 silencing.","FOXA1 is overexpressed in aggressive thyroid cancers and involved in cell cycle progression in an ATC cell line. Therefore, FOXA1 may be an important oncogene in thyroid tumorigenesis and a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancers.",closed_qa
Does environmental influence in ulcerative colitis start in early childhood?,"The present analysis served to address the question at what age environmental factors start to exert their influence on the occurrence of ulcerative colitis. Mortality data from 21 different countries were accumulated between 1941 and 2004 to analyse the variation of age-specific death rates during consecutive time periods and among different countries. Between 1941 and 2004 the trends of mortality from ulcerative colitis among different age groups formed a fan-like pattern with a progressively steeper decline of mortality among increasingly younger age groups. This general pattern included mortality in all age groups older than 5 years, but was absent in the youngest age group, 0-4 years. In countries with frequent occurrence of ulcerative colitis, high mortality from ulcerative colitis affected different age groups alike. This pattern was reflected by a set of statistically significant correlations between the mortality of each two consecutive age groups from different countries. The progression of significant correlations among consecutive age groups broke off only when the geographic variations of the age groups 0-4 and 5-9 years were compared.",The analysis suggests that environmental factors responsible for the temporal and geographic variations of ulcerative colitis start to exert their influence during early childhood.,closed_qa
Are exon 15 BRAF mutations uncommon in melanomas arising in nonsun-exposed sites?,"An activating point mutation of the BRAF oncogene has been identified in a high proportion of cutaneous nevi and cutaneous melanomas, but its frequency in melanomas arising from the mucosa of head and neck is unknown. We tested 17 malignant mucosal melanomas of the head and neck for the thymine (T)-->adenine (A) missense mutation at nucleotide 1796 in the BRAF gene using direct sequencing and a newly developed assay that uses a novel primer extension method (Mutector assay). We also tested 21 cutaneous melanomas, including 13 arising from sun-exposed sites and 8 from a nonsun-exposed site, the vulvar skin. The 1796T-->A mutation was detected in only 1 (6%) of the sinonasal melanomas. As for cutaneous melanomas, a BRAF mutation was detected in 8 (62%) of the tumors arising in sun-exposed sites but in none (0%) of vulvar melanomas.","In contrast to cutaneous melanomas arising in sun-exposed sites, mucosal melanomas of the head and neck do not frequently harbor an activating mutation of BRAF. This finding additionally supports the view that the various subtypes of melanoma are not equivalent and that distinct genetic alterations may underlie well recognized differences in risk factors and behavioral patterns. Accordingly, patients with melanomas should not be collectively regarded as a uniform group as new strategies are developed that target specific genetic alterations.",closed_qa
Does artificial sweetener reduce nociceptive reaction in term newborn infants?,"Sucrose has been shown to have an analgesic effect in preterm and term neonates. Sucrose, however, has a high osmolarity and may have deleterious effects in infants with fructose intolerance. Furthermore, it may favour caries. We therefore investigated the effects of a commercially available artificial sweetener (10 parts cyclamate and 1 part saccharin), glycine (sweet amino acid) or breast milk in reducing reaction to pain as compared with a placebo. Eighty healthy term infants, four days old, with normal birth weight. The infants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 2 ml sweetener, glycine, expressed breast milk or water were given 2 min before a heel prick for the Guthrie test. The procedure was filmed with a video camera and analysed by two observers who did not know which medication the infant had received. Using a multivariate regression analysis, the following variables had significant correlation with relative crying time and recovery time: behavioural state before the intervention, the pricking nurse, and the type of medication. Relative crying time and recovery time were significantly less in the sweetener group but not in the glycine and the breast milk group.","The artificial sweetener used in our study reduces pain reaction to a heel prick in term neonates, and thus provides an alternative to sucrose. In contrast, glycine tends to increase pain reaction whereas breast milk has no effect.",closed_qa
Does coronary artery constriction in rats affect the activation of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in cardiac myocytes?,"To determine whether alpha 1 adrenergic receptor mediated myocyte contractility and growth are depressed acutely after non-occlusive coronary artery narrowing, the left coronary artery was constricted in rats and mechanical behaviour, cytosolic calcium, and regulation of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors were examined in myocytes seven days later. Coronary artery stenosis was surgically induced in rats and following the estimation of global cardiac performance myocytes were enzymatically dissociated and radioligand binding studies were performed. In addition, the isotonic contractile performance, cytosolic calcium transients and noradrenaline stimulated inositol phosphate generation in myocytes were measured in the presence of WB 4101 or after chlorethylclonidine treatment. Estimations of cell mechanics in vitro established that peak shortening was decreased by 36% and 18% in left and right ventricular myocytes of coronary stenosed rats. Time to peak shortening was prolonged by 29% in left and 20% in right myocytes, whereas velocity of shortening was decreased by 27% in left myocytes. These alterations were associated with increases in cell length and width, indicative of myocyte hypertrophy. In addition, coronary stenosis was accompanied by reductions in the expression of alpha 1a and alpha 1b receptor subtypes in myocytes. alpha 1 Adrenergic receptor density and noradrenaline stimulated phosphoinositol turnover were decreased by 30% and 34% in left myocytes. alpha 1a Adrenergic receptor subtype mediated cytosolic calcium concentration and myocyte mechanical performance were also impaired in left myocytes only. The alpha 1a adrenergic receptor subtype antagonist WB 4101 abolished noradrenaline stimulated inositol phosphate generation in myocytes, whereas chlorethylclonidine at large doses only partially inhibited this response.","In conclusion, coronary narrowing leads to defects in the regulation of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors on myocytes which are coupled with attenuation in the transmission of signals, possibly affecting myocyte cell function and ongoing reactive cellular hypertrophy.",closed_qa
Does glucose variability negatively impact long-term functional outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury?,"Significant glycemic excursions (so-called glucose variability) affect the outcome of generic critically ill patients but has not been well studied in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of glucose variability on long-term functional outcome of patients with TBI. A noncomputerized tight glucose control protocol was used in our intensivist model surgical intensive care unit. The relationship between the glucose variability and long-term (a median of 6 months after injury) functional outcome defined by extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) was analyzed using ordinal logistic regression models. Glucose variability was defined by SD and percentage of excursion (POE) from the preset range glucose level. A total of 109 patients with TBI under tight glucose control had long-term GOSE evaluated. In univariable analysis, there was a significant association between lower GOSE score and higher mean glucose, higher SD, POE more than 60, POE 80 to 150, and single episode of glucose less than 60 mg/dL but not POE 80 to 110. After adjusting for possible confounding variables in multivariable ordinal logistic regression models, higher SD, POE more than 60, POE 80 to 150, and single episode of glucose less than 60 mg/dL were significantly associated with lower GOSE score.",Glucose variability was significantly associated with poorer long-term functional outcome in patients with TBI as measured by the GOSE score.

Does association of sleep habits with accidents and near miss in United States transportation operators?,"To explore sleep risk factors and their association with adverse events in transportation operators. Self-reported sleep-related behaviors were analyzed in transportation operators (drivers, pilots, and rail operators) aged 26 to 78 years who completed the National Sleep Foundation's 2012 ""Planes, Trains, Automobiles, and Sleep"" survey. Regression analyses were used to assess the associations of various sleep-related variables with the combined outcome of self-reported accidents and near misses. Age- and body mass-adjusted predictors of accidents/near misses included an accident while commuting (odds ratio [OR] = 4.6; confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 9.8), driving drowsy (OR = 4.1; CI, 2.5 to 6.7), and Sheehan Disability Scale score greater than 15 (OR = 3.5; CI, 2.2 to 5.5). Sleeping more than 7 hours nightly was protective for accident/near misses (OR = 0.6; CI, 0.4 to 0.9).",Recognized risk factors for poor sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness were significantly associated with self-reported near misses and/or accidents in transportation operators.,closed_qa
Does dialysis within 24 hours of transplant improve graft function?,"Grafts from extended criteria donors, donors after cardiac death, and elderly donors have an increased risk of delayed graft function, lower graft survival, longer hospital stay, higher costs, and increased medical sequelae. A modifiable risk factor for delayed graft function may be the performance of dialysis on the same day as renal transplant. We reviewed our institutional experience to determine whether dialysis performed within 24 hours of engraftment increased the incidence or length of delayed graft function. We retrospectively reviewed our kidney transplants performed between 2008 and 2012. Preemptive transplants, transplants associated with peritoneal dialysis, potassium > 5 mmol/L, or living donors, and cases with insufficient information were excluded. Data collected included demographic, biochemical, donor, operative, and outcome variables (length of stay, length of delayed graft function, rejection, and a composite unfavorable outcome comprising cardiac and infectious events). Transplants that were associated with hemodialysis within 24 hours before transplant (study group) were compared with the remainder of the cohort (control group). A total of 205 renal transplants were reviewed. There were 144 of 205 transplants (70.24%) in the study group, and the others comprised the control group. The rate of delayed graft function was 31% for the study group and 29% for control groups (P = .4959). Mean length of delayed graft function was 5.8 days for the study group and 6.1 days for control group (P = .7323). Delayed graft function risk factors such as donor age, terminal creatinine, and machine perfusion rate were similarly distributed across both groups.","Normokalemic patients who did or did not undergo dialysis within 24 hours before transplant had equivalent incidence and duration of delayed graft function, graft outcomes, and patient outcomes. Therefore, dialysis within 24 hours before transplant is unnecessary in the setting of normokalemia.",closed_qa
Do endometrial cancer patients benefit from metformin intake?,"Since metformin was reported to decrease overall cancer incidence and mortality and to have antiproliferative and antinvasive properties, we investigated the impact of metformin intake on survival in endometrial cancer patients. Medical records and survival data of 126 patients with endometrial cancer were analyzed retrospectively U Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests were applied to compare clinicopathological features. Kaplan Meier model with log-rank test was used to compare survival in the subgroups. Cox proportional hazard model was applied to analyze the relationships between particular factors and overall survival. 107 patients met study criteria and were divided into three groups: 1) patients with type 2 diabetes and metformin users (n = 30), 2) patients with type 2 diabetes and metformin non-users (n = 38), 3) patients without diabetes mellitus (n = 39). No difference in survival between metformin users versus metformin non-users (p = 0.86) was observed. Metformin intake, diabetes mellitus co morbidity, plasma glucose level and BMI appeared without influence on survival. When the analysis was restricted to the subgroup of type I endometrial cancer or to endometroid histological type, still neither metformin intake nor diabetes influenced the prognosis.",Metformin intake does not alter overall survival in endometrial cancer patients.

Do reintroductions and genetic introgression from domestic pigs have shaped the genetic population structure of Northwest European wild boar?,"Population genetic studies focus on natural dispersal and isolation by landscape barriers as the main drivers of genetic population structure. However, anthropogenic factors such as reintroductions, translocations and wild x domestic hybridization may also have strong effects on genetic population structure. In this study we genotyped 351 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers evenly spread across the genome in 645 wild boar (Sus scrofa) from Northwest Europe to evaluate determinants of genetic population structure. We show that wild boar genetic population structure is influenced by historical reintroductions and by genetic introgression from domestic pigs. Six genetically distinct and geographically coherent wild boar clusters were identified in the Netherlands and Western Germany. The Dutch Veluwe cluster is known to be reintroduced, and three adjacent Dutch and German clusters are suspected to be a result of reintroduction, based on clustering results, low levels of heterozygosity and relatively high genetic distances to nearby populations. Recent wild x domestic hybrids were found geographically widespread across clusters and at low frequencies (average 3.9%). The relationship between pairwise kinship coefficients and geographic distance showed male-biased dispersal at the population genetic level.","Our results demonstrate that wildlife and landscape management by humans are shaping the genetic diversity of an iconic wildlife species. Historical reintroductions, translocation and recent restocking activities with farmed wild boar have all influenced wild boar genetic population structure. The current trend of wild boar population growth and range expansion has recently led to a number of contact zones between clusters, and further admixture between the different wild boar clusters is to be expected.",closed_qa
Is hIV-DNA in the genital tract of women on long-term effective therapy associated to residual viremia and previous AIDS-defining illnesses?,"To assess the impact of long-term combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) on HIV-RNA and HIV-DNA levels in cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-1-infected women with sustained undetectable plasma RNA viral load (PVL); to explore factors predictive of residual viral shedding; and to evaluate the risk of heterosexual transmission. Women with undetectable PVL (<50 copies/mL) for >6 months were included in this cross-sectional study. HIV-RNA and HIV-DNA were measured in blood and cervicovaginal lavage fluid (CVL). Women were systematically tested for genital infections. The risk of transmission to male partners during unprotected intercourse was estimated. Eighty-one women composed the study population: all had HIV-RNA <40 copies/mL in CVL. HIV-DNA was detectable in CVL of 29/78 patients (37%). There was a weak positive correlation between HIV-DNA levels in PBMCs and CVL (r = 0.20; p = 0.08). In multivariate analysis, two factors were associated with HIV-DNA detection in CVL: previous AIDS-defining illnesses (OR = 11; 95%CI = 2-61) and current residual viremia (20<PVL<50 cp/mL) (OR = 3.4; 95%CI = 1.1-10.9). Neither the classes of cART regimen nor the presence of genital bacterial or fungal colonization were associated with HIV-DNA detection in CVL. Twenty-eight percent of the women had unprotected intercourse with their regular HIV-seronegative male partner, for between 8 and 158 months. None of their male partners became infected, after a total of 14 000 exposures.","In our experience, HIV-RNA was undetectable in the genital tract of women with sustained control of PVL on cART. HIV-DNA shedding persisted in about one third of cases, with no substantial evidence of residual infectiousness.",closed_qa
Do drug prices reflect development time and government investment?,"Lengthy development times are cited by the pharmaceutical industry as one reason for high drug prices. We compared the prices of different groups of drugs after accounting for development time, government support, market size, and other drug characteristics. We conducted a retrospective study of 180 human therapeutic drugs categorized into 8 drug groups by assembling data on drug development times, government support, drug characteristics, and prices. First, we compared the development time and level of government support across the 8 drug groups. Second, we assessed the independent effect of drug group on median price per day in a multivariable analysis, controlling for development time and all other variables. Thirty percent of antiretroviral drugs had government patents compared with 16% of other infectious disease drugs, 6% of cancer drugs, and less than 6% of any other drug group (P<0.002). Fifty percent of antiretrovirals had NIH trials listed in the new drug application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration compared with less than 6% of any other drug group (P<0.001). More antiretroviral and cancer drugs received fast track status and accelerated review during regulatory review by the Food and Drug Administration (P<0.001). The median price of antiretrovirals was 8 US dollars per day more, cancer drugs 11 US dollars per day more, than the reference group after adjustment for other variables (P<0.001). Development time was not associated with drug price.","Antiretroviral and cancer drugs, even after accounting for development time, are among the most highly priced medications.

Does moderate hypothermia ameliorate liver energy failure after intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion in anaesthetised rats?,"Intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) can cause liver failure. The aims of this work were to study the effects of intestinal IR on liver energy metabolism and to evaluate the effects of moderate hypothermia. Intestinal IR (90-minute intestinal ischaemia plus 60-minute or 240-minute reperfusion) was achieved by clamping and unclamping the superior mesenteric artery in rats. Normothermia or moderate hypothermia (30 degrees to 33 degrees C) was maintained by adjusting the environmental temperature. The ratio of hepatic inorganic phosphate to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was monitored continuously during intestinal IR using in vivo phosphorus ((31)P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Phosphorus metabolites also were measured in extracts prepared from freeze-clamped liver and intestine. Mortality occurred exclusively during normothermic intestinal IR. A progressive increase in the hepatic inorganic phosphate to ATP ratio after normothermic intestinal IR was observed. Moderate hypothermia delayed this effect. Analysis of liver extracts confirmed above findings. However, there was no difference in intestinal phosphocreatine or ATP between normothermic and hypothermic rats undergoing intestinal IR.",Intestinal IR at normothermia was associated with liver energy failure and high mortality rate.

Benign biliary obstruction: is treatment with the Wallstent advisable?,"To evaluate the effectiveness of the self-expanding Wallstent in the treatment of benign biliary strictures. Twenty patients with benign biliary strictures were included in this retrospective study. Seven patients had chronic pancreatitis, two had fibrous papillary stenosis, one had primary sclerosing cholangitis, and 10 had postsurgical strictures, including four who had a stenosed bilidigestive anastomosis. Primary and secondary patency of the stents and clinical outcome after stent insertion were evaluated. Stent placement was successful in all patients. At the end of the observation period, which lasted 3-78 months (mean, 31.2 months +/- 4.5 [standard error]), 10 patients were alive. Median primary patency was 32 months +/- 8.7. In 10 patients, patency was preserved during the observation period (two with secondary patency). Six patients had a good clinical result. Among the other four patients, one had recurrent cholangitis, one had a biliary abscess, and two had stent revisions. In the other patients, stents became occluded after 3-55 months. The reason for stent occlusion was a stone in one patient; in the others, the causes were not proved.","Results of stent placement for treatment of benign biliary strictures are not encouraging.

Are starch and starch hydrolysates favorable carbon sources for bifidobacteria in the human gut?,"Bifidobacteria are key commensals in human gut, and their abundance is associated with the health of their hosts. Although they are dominant in infant gut, their number becomes lower in adult gut. The changes of the diet are considered to be main reason for this difference. Large amounts of whole-genomic sequence data of bifidobacteria make it possible to elucidate the genetic interpretation of their adaptation to the nutrient environment. Among the nutrients in human gut, starch is a highly fermentable substrate and can exert beneficial effects by increasing bifidobacteria and/or being fermented to short chain fatty acids. In order to determine the potential substrate preference of bifidobacteria, we compared the glycoside hydrolase (GH) profiles of a pooled-bifidobacterial genome (PBG) with a representative microbiome (RM) of the human gut. In bifidobacterial genomes, only 15% of GHs contained signal peptides, suggesting their weakness in utilization of complex carbohydrate, such as plant cell wall polysaccharides. However, compared with other intestinal bacteria, bifidobacteiral genomes encoded more GH genes for degrading starch and starch hydrolysates, indicating that they have genetic advantages in utilizing these substrates. Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum BBMN68 isolated from centenarian's faeces was used as a model strain to further investigate the carbohydrate utilization. The pathway for degrading starch and starch hydrolysates was the only complete pathway for complex carbohydrates in human gut. It is noteworthy that all of the GH genes for degrading starch and starch hydrolysates in the BBMN68 genome were conserved in all studied bifidobacterial strains. The in silico analyses of BBMN68 were further confirmed by growth experiments, proteomic and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analyses.",Our results demonstrated that starch and starch hydrolysates were the most universal and favorable carbon sources for bifidobacteria. The low amount of these carbon sources in adult intestine was speculated to contribute to the low relative abundance of bifidobacteria.,closed_qa
Does rat liver fibrosis regress better with pegylated interferon alpha2b and ursodeoxycholic acid treatments than spontaneous recovery?,"Fibrosis and cirrhosis are common complications of chronic liver diseases. An imbalance between fibrogenesis and fibrolysis results in scarring of the liver parenchyma. We aimed to investigate the possible antifibrotic effectiveness of a newly modified interferon molecule peginterferon alpha2b (PEG-IFNalpha2b) which has better antiviral activity, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Liver fibrosis was established on 60 male Sprague Dawley rats with CCl4 in 12 weeks. After cessation of CCl4 Group I was left for spontaneous recovery. Group II was treated with PEG-IFN 1.5 microg/kg/week, Group III with UDCA 25 mg/kg/day and Group IV with combination of both drugs. All rats were killed at week 16. Histopathologic fibrosis scores, tissue hydroxyproline, TIMP-1 and MMP-13 levels were determined. Hepatic stellate cell apoptosis was detected by dual staining with TUNEL technique and anti-alpha smooth muscle actin. Fibrosis scores were lower in Group II, III and IV than Group I (p<0.05 for group I vs. II and III; p<0.01 for group I vs. IV). Tissue hydroxyproline levels were significantly decreased in Group II, III and IV when compared to Group I (p<0.05 for group I vs. II, p<0.01 for group I vs. III and IV). Lower liver TIMP-1 and higher MMP-13 levels were measured in Group II, III, and Group IV than Group I (p<0.01 for TIMP-1 and p<0.01, for MMP). Activated HSC apoptosis was significantly increased in Group II, III and IV when compared to Group I (p<0.01, for all). There was significantly higher apoptosis in Group II than Group III and IV (p<0.01).",Treatment with both PEG-IFNalpha2b and UDCA improved CCl4 induced rat liver fibrosis.

Bipolar spectrum disorders in a clinical sample of patients with Internet addiction: hidden comorbidity or differential diagnosis?,"Behavioral addictions and bipolar disorders have a certain probability of co-occurrence. While the presence of a manic episode has been defined as an exclusion criterion for gambling disorder, no such exclusion has been formulated for Internet addiction. A clinical sample of 368 treatment seekers presenting with excessive to addictive Internet use was screened for bipolar spectrum disorders using the Mood Disorder Questionnaire. Psychopathology was assessed by the Symptom Checklist 90R and a clinical interview was administered to screen for comorbid disorders. Comorbid bipolar disorders were more frequent in patients meeting criteria for Internet addiction (30.9%) than among the excessive users (5.6%). This subgroup showed heightened psychopathological symptoms, including substance use disorders, affective disorders and personality disorders. Further differences were found regarding frequency of Internet use regarding social networking sites and online-pornography. Patients with Internet addiction have a heightened probability for meeting criteria of bipolar disorders. It is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the direction of this association but it is recommended to implement screening for bipolar disorders in patients presenting with Internet addiction.","Similar to gambling disorder, it might prove necessary to subsume bipolar disorders as an exclusion criterion for the future criteria of Internet addiction.",closed_qa
Does enalaprilat directly ameliorate in vitro cyclosporin nephrotoxicity in human tubulo-interstitial cells?,"Several recent studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ameliorate chronic cyclosporin A (CyA) tubulo-interstitial disease by mechanisms independent of their antihypertensive effects. The aim of the present study was to determine whether ACE inhibition exerts a direct beneficial effect on the tubulo-interstitium in an in vitro model of chronic CyA nephropathy. Primary cultures of human proximal tubular cells (PTC) and renal cortical fibroblasts (CF) were exposed for 24 h to CyA in the presence or absence of enalaprilat. Parameters of tubulo-interstitial nephrotoxicity were then measured including collagen synthesis (proline incorporation), tubular viability and function (thymidine incorporation, lactate dehydrogenase release, and apical sodium-hydrogen exchange), and secretion of insulin-like growth factor I, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1), and platelet-derived growth factor. CyA promoted CF collagen synthesis, PTC cytotoxicity (suppressed viability, growth and sodium transport), and tubulo-interstitial fibrogenic cytokine release (CF secretion of insulin-like growth factor I and PTC secretion of TGFbeta1 and platelet-derived growth factor). Enalaprilat completely reversed the stimulatory effects of CyA on CF collagen synthesis (CyA + enalaprilat 6.40 +/- 0.50% vs. CyA alone 8.33 +/- 0.56% vs. control 6.57 +/- 0.62% vs. enalaprilat alone 5.55 +/- 0.93%, p < 0.05) and PTC secretion of TGFbeta1 (0.71 +/- 0.11, 1.13 +/- 0.09, 0.89 +/- 0.07, and 0.67 +/- 0.09 ng/mg protein/day, respectively, p < 0.05). However, the other manifestations of CyA toxicity were not significantly reversed by concomitant enalaprilat administration.","ACE inhibition directly prevents CyA-induced interstitial fibrosis, but not proximal tubule cytotoxicity, independently of haemodynamic and systemic renin-angiotensin system effects.

Does age affect analgesia provision at discharge among children with long bone fractures requiring emergency care?,"Inadequate treatment of painful conditions in children is a significant and complex problem. The wide range of cognitive abilities associated with a child's age is a particular challenge for providers treating children with painful conditions. To examine the effect of patient age on the provision of analgesic medicines at discharge in children treated emergently for a long bone fracture. A retrospective review was performed of all patients during a 1-year period with a long bone fracture treated in two urban pediatric Emergency Departments (EDs). Eight hundred seventy-eight patients were identified who met our inclusion criteria. Nearly 60% of patients received a prescription for an opioid-containing medicine and 19% received a prescription for an over-the-counter analgesic medicine at ED discharge. Patients younger than 4 years old had lower pain scores, less severe fractures, and overall were significantly less likely to receive an opioid-containing prescription compared to children 4 years old or greater. In children with more severe fractures requiring reduction in the ED, no significant age-related differences were noted in opioid prescription rates.

Does an unusual case of spinal dysraphism with four split including three posterior spurs?,"Composite-type split spinal cord malformation (SCM) is very rare and results from 2 separate foci of ectoendodermal adhesions and endomesenchymal tracts leading to the development of SCM with an intervening normal cord in the same patient. Posterior spurs are even rarer. We report a unique case of composite SCM, where the patient had 3 posterior bony spurs and 1 fibrous spur at different levels. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a patient having composite-type SCM with posterior spurs at 3 different levels. A 3-year-old girl presented to us with progressively worsening scoliosis. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for mild weakness in the left lower limb. Three-dimensional CT imaging demonstrated posterior bony spurs located at T(6), T(12) and L(3) levels. The patient underwent T(11)-L(5) laminoplasty and T(5)/T(6) laminectomy and excision of SCM type 1 with division of the thickened filum terminale. All the bony spurs arose from the inner surface of the lamina, where the base of the spur was located.","The unique point of this case report is the rarity of such a presentation. Careful planning and knowledge of the occurrence of such conditions can make surgery in these children safe, and all the levels can be treated in a single setting.",closed_qa
Does an anti-c-Fms antibody inhibit osteoclastogenesis in a mouse periodontitis model?,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce inflammatory bone loss such as periodontal disease. The formation of osteoclasts depends on macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kb ligand (RANKL). It has recently been reported that administration of an antibody of the M-CSF receptor c-Fms completely blocked osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion induced by LPS in mouse calvaria. In this study, the effect of antibody against c-Fms in the mouse periodontitis model by injection of LPS was investigated. C57BL6/J mice were injected with LPS and anti-c-Fms antibody into the mesial gingiva of the first molar in the left mandible. Histological sections of periodontal tissue were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and osteoclast numbers and ratio of alveolar bone resorption determined. The number of osteoclasts and ratio of alveolar bone resorption in mice administered both LPS and anti-c-Fms antibody was lower than those in mice administered LPS alone. The expression of RANKL receptor, RANK, was inhibited by the anti-c-Fms antibody in periodontal tissue.","M-CSF and/or its receptor are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of bone resorption, caused by LPS, in periodontitis. Injection of an anti-c-Fms antibody might be useful for inhibition of pathological bone resorption in periodontitis.",closed_qa
Do depressed patients understand heart failure prognosis but not how to control it?,"Depression prevalence in patients with heart failure (HF) is 21% to 42%. Conceptual illness beliefs that patients have about HF may be associated with depression. We examined whether accuracy of illness beliefs was associated with depression. Illness belief scores were compared with depression severity, and multivariable analyses were performed to determine factors that were independently associated with depression. In 219 elderly patients with HF, depression prevalence was 47%. Accuracy of illness beliefs was associated with depression (r = .224; P = .049), due solely to accuracy of beliefs about consequences of HF (P = .005). Beliefs about how to control HF remained stable as depression severity increased. After controlling for significant univariable factors, mean illness belief and consequence scores remained associated with depression.","In this sample, accuracy of beliefs about HF consequences increased but beliefs about how to control HF remained unchanged as depression severity worsened. This combination of HF beliefs may influence coping through self-care behaviors.",closed_qa
Does hand hygiene with alcohol hand rub and gloves reduce the incidence of late onset sepsis in preterm neonates?,"To assess the impact of a hand hygiene protocol, using hand washing, alcohol hand rub and gloves when caring for preterm infants born after 31 weeks of gestation, on the incidence of neonatal late onset sepsis (LOS). All babies delivered between 32 + 0 and 36 + 6 weeks gestation and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit during a 14-month period were included. We followed a hand hygiene protocol with hand washing and alcohol hand rub (hand rub period) for the first 7 months and a protocol of hand washing, alcohol hand rub and gloves (gloves period) for the second 7 months. The hand rub and gloves groups consisted of 111 and 89 patients, respectively. Five patients were diagnosed with a total of six episodes of LOS in the hand rub group, and the incidence of LOS during the hand rub period was 2.99/1000 hospital days and 54.1/1000 admissions. There were no patients diagnosed with LOS during the gloves period (significant decrease, p = 0.028).","Using a hand hygiene protocol with hand washing, hand rub and gloves significantly reduced the incidence of LOS in preterm newborns, and the results suggest that it may produce a sustained improvement in the infection rate.",closed_qa
Does surgical trauma induce group II phospholipase A2 production by neutrophils at a local site after surgery?,"Group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2) regulates eicosanoids and platelet activating factor (PAF) production and plays an important role in regulating critical mediators in inflammatory diseases such as trauma, sepsis and multiple organ failure. To elucidate the local effect of surgical trauma, we investigated the production of group II PLA2 at a local site after surgery. We utilized a radioimmunoassay to measure group II PLA2 levels in peritoneal exudates from the operative field and blood in patients who underwent gastrectomy. We also investigated the production of group II PLA2 in cells from peritoneal exudates by Northern blotting and immunocytochemistry. Immunoreactive group II PLA2 levels were significantly increased from 3 h after surgery and peaked at 12 h peritoneal exudates. However, serum group II PLA2 levels peaked at 24-48 h and decreased gradually after surgery, findings similar to levels of postoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP). There was no significant correlation between group II PLA2 levels in peritoneal exudates and those in blood. Group II PLA2 mRNA was expressed at high level in cells from peritoneal exudates, by Northern blot analysis, but not those from blood. The localization of group II PLA2 protein was intense in neutrophils, as determined by immunocytochemistry. No group II PLA2 expression was observed in corresponding peripheral blood cells.","After surgery, group II PLA2 is increased in peritoneal exudates prior to elevation in the blood circulation and is produced by neutrophils recruited and activated at a local site. Group II PLA2 produced in peritoneal exudates by neutrophils has an important role in the physiological and pathological states at a local site, after surgery.",closed_qa
"Apophysial joint degeneration, disc degeneration, and sagittal curve of the cervical spine. Can they be measured reliably on radiographs?","Interexaminer reliability study. To determine the reliability of grading apophysial joint and disc degenerative changes and the reliability of measuring sagittal curves on lateral cervical spine radiographs. Several authors have proposed that the presented of degenerative changes and the absence of lordosis in the cervical spine are indicators of poor recovery from neck injuries caused by motor vehicle collisions. The validity of those conclusions is questionable because the reliability of the methods used in their studies to measure the presence of degenerative changes and the absence of lordosis has not been determined. Kellgren's classification system for apophysial joint and disc degeneration, as well as the pattern and magnitude of the sagittal curve on 30 lateral cervical spine radiographs were assessed independently by three examiners. Moderate reliability was demonstrated for classifying apophysial joint degeneration with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.45 (95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.71). Classifying degenerative disc disease had substantial reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.88). Measuring the magnitude of the sagittal curve from C2 to C7 had excellent interexaminer agreement, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.98) and an interexaminer error of 8.3 degrees.",The classification system for degenerative disc disease proposed by Kellgren et al and the method of measurement of sagittal curves from C2 to C7 demonstrated an acceptable level of reliability and can be used in outcomes research.,closed_qa
Is location in the ascending colon a predictor of refractory colonic diverticular hemorrhage after endoscopic clipping?,"Predictors of refractory colonic diverticular hemorrhage after endoscopic clipping (EC) remain unclear. To elucidate the predictors of uncontrolled bleeding after EC. Retrospective study. Two tertiary referral centers. Eighty-nine patients with colonic diverticular hemorrhage who underwent EC as a first-line treatment were included. If bleeding remained uncontrolled after 1 or 2 EC sessions, other interventions (transcatheter arterial embolization, endoscopic band ligation, or surgery) were performed. Patients were divided into EC-controlled and EC-uncontrolled groups; the characteristics of each group were compared. Comorbidities, location of bleeding diverticula, and EC technique (direct vs indirect placement). Initial treatment with EC was successful in 87 patients. Early rebleeding (primary failure) occurred in 30 of 87 patients (34%). Secondary failure occurred in 6 of 22 patients treated with reclipping (27%). Cumulatively, 78 patients were successfully managed with EC. Non-EC treatments were required in 11 patients. Location in the right side of the colon, particularly in the ascending colon, was significantly more common in the EC-uncontrolled group than in the EC-controlled group (P = .017 and P = .0029, respectively). Although the difference was not significant, bleeding was successfully managed in all 13 patients treated with direct placement. Bleeding remained uncontrolled after EC in 11 of 52 ascending cases (21%) treated with indirect placement. Diverticular hemorrhage in other locations was managed regardless of EC technique.",Retrospective study.,closed_qa
Does the Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine promote corneal debridement wound closure in vivo?,"To investigate the effect of the Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine on corneal debridement wound healing in vivo. Corneal debridement wounds of 1.5 mm were made on the ocular surface of CD-1 mice. A 20 microl drop of 15 microM olomoucine in 1% DMSO was applied to the wound area immediately after wounding and again after 6 h. Control mice received identical applications of 1% DMSO. Mice were euthanized after 18 h, two weeks, and three weeks for evaluation of wound healing and restratification. Corneas were stained with Richardson's dye, photographed, and processed for histology and immunofluorescence as whole mounts or paraffin sections. The remaining wound area at 18 h was measured by image analysis. Scratch wounded cultures of human corneal-limbal epithelial cells (HCLE) were used to examine the effect of olomoucine on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in vitro. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were detected by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Olomoucine treatment significantly enhanced corneal wound closure without increasing inflammation or infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes 18 h after wounding (p<0.05). The increased localization of MMP-9 within epithelial cells at the wound edge was further enhanced by olomoucine while the expression of MMP-2 was reduced. Olomoucine treatment of scratch wounded HCLE cells produced similar changes in MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression. The examination of treated corneas two and three weeks after wounding showed normal epithelial restratification with no evidence of inflammation or stromal disorganization.",Topical application of olomoucine in 1% DMSO significantly enhances closure of small epithelial debridement wounds without increasing inflammation or impairing reepithelialization.,closed_qa
Does remission on thiopurinic immunomodulators normalize quality of life and psychological status in patients with Crohn 's disease?,"Thiopurinic immunomodulators are effective for maintaining symptom remission in Crohn's disease. Little is known, however, about their effect on patients' quality of life or psychological well-being. The present study aimed to determine whether remission induced by thiopurinic immunomodulators returns levels of quality of life and psychological well-being to normal. A case-control study was performed. Cases were 33 patients with Crohn's disease treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and in stable remission for at least 6 months. Sixty-six healthy individuals matched 2:1 by age and sex and 14 patients with active Crohn's disease were included as control groups. Quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form (SF-36) questionnaire, and the respective Hamilton rating scales were used for anxiety and depression. ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction was used for multiple comparisons. SF-36 global scores were 85 in the study group, 85 in healthy controls (P = 1), and 58.6 in patients with active disease (P < 0.001 for the comparison with the other 2 groups). The differences between values were 0 (95% CI -4-4), 26.4 (95% CI 20-32), and 26.4 (95% CI 19-33), respectively. The respective anxiety and depression scores were 6.5, 5.5, and 16.2 and 3.7, 3.3, and 10.9.

Does recombinant Osteopontin stabilize Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotype via Integrin Receptor/Integrin-Linked Kinase/Rac-1 Pathway After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats?,"Recombinant osteopontin (rOPN) has been reported to be neuroprotective in stroke animal models. The purpose of this study is to investigate a potential role and mechanism of nasal administration of rOPN on preserving the vascular smooth muscle phenotype in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). One hundred and ninety-two male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation. Integrin-linked kinase small interfering RNA was intracerebroventricularly injected 48 hours before SAH. The integrin receptor antagonist fibronectin-derived peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP), focal adhesion kinase inhibitor Fib-14, and Rac-1 inhibitor NSC23766 were administered 1 hour before SAH induction. rOPN was administered via the intracerebroventricular and nasal route after SAH. SAH grade, neurological scores, brain water content, brain swelling, hematoxylin and eosin staining, India ink angiography, Western blots, and immunofluorescence were used to study the mechanisms of rOPN on the vascular smooth muscle phenotypic transformation. The marker proteins of vascular smooth muscle phenotypic transformation α-smooth muscle actin decreased and embryonic smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMemb) increased significantly at 24 and 72 hours in the cerebral arteries after SAH. rOPN prevented the changes of α-smooth muscle actin and SMemb and significantly alleviated neurobehavioral dysfunction, increased the cross-sectional area and the lumen diameter of the cerebral arteries, reduced the brain water content and brain swelling, and improved the wall thickness of cerebral arteries. These effects of rOPN were abolished by GRGDSP, integrin-linked kinase small interfering RNA, and NSC23766. Intranasal application of rOPN at 3 hours after SAH also reduced neurological deficits.","rOPN prevented the vascular smooth muscle phenotypic transformation and improved the neurological outcome, which was possibly mediated by the integrin receptor/integrin-linked kinase/Rac-1 pathway.",closed_qa
Does reduced expression of Apaf-1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma correlate with tumor progression and aggressive phenotype?,"Apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) is one of the key regulators in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and the loss of Apaf-1 leads to cellular resistance against the apoptotic signals. We investigated the expression of Apaf-1 in colorectal tissues corresponding to the multistep carcinogenesis model to determine correlations between the clinicopathologic characteristics and the expression of this molecule and to evaluate the role of Apaf-1 in the development and progression of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry for Apaf-1 was performed on the tissue microarray of 38 normal mucosal tissues, 46 adenomatous polyps, 529 colorectal adenocarcinomas, and 76 metastatic tumors. Normal colonic mucosa tissues and adenomas were positive for Apaf-1 with no exceptions (100%). However, in colorectal adenocarcinomas, 119 of 529 cases (22.5%) were positive and 410 cases (77.5%) were negative. Moreover, 67 of 76 metastatic cases (88.2 %) were negative and only nine cases (11.8%) were positive for Apaf-1 expression. In the analyses between Apaf-1 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, reduced expression of Apaf-1 correlated with left colon location (p < 0.001), deeper tumor invasion (p < 0.001), frequent lymph node metastasis (p = 0.021), higher American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and Dukes' stage (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001, respectively) and poorer differentiation (p < 0.001). The patient survival was significantly associated with age, histological grade, AJCC stage, and lymphovascular invasion, but not Apaf-1 expression (p = 0.478).",The results suggest that the loss of Apaf-1 expression is a relatively frequent late event and the loss of Apaf-1 expression may play an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in colorectal adenocarcinoma.,closed_qa
Is modulation of mTOR Activity by μ-Opioid Receptor Dependent upon the Association of Receptor and FK506-Binding Protein 12?,"Mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation by μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) participates in antinociceptive tolerance, hyperalgesia, and physical dependence. Our previous study also showed that mTOR activation by OPRM1 could attenuate β amyloid oligomers-induced neurotoxicity. OPRM1 is demonstrated to interact with FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12). It is our great interest to investigate whether OPRM1-mediated mTOR signaling is related to receptor-FKBP12 association. The activities of mTOR and its downstream effector p70 S6K were measured by immunoblotting their phosphorylation status. The interaction of receptor with mTOR was detected by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. OPRM1 activation by morphine-induced time-dependent mTOR activation. PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 only blocked the late phase of mTOR activation. However, morphine-induced mTOR activation was totally blocked at all time points in cells expressing FKBP12 association-deficient mutant receptor. FKBP12 knockdown also blocked morphine-induced mTOR activation. Further analysis demonstrated that morphine treatment enhanced the association of receptor with phosphorylated mTOR, whereas decreased association was observed after FKBP12 knockdown, mTOR inhibition or in cells expressing FKBP12 association-deficient mutant.","OPRM1-FKBP12 association played a key role in OPRM1-mediated mTOR activation, which could underlie the mechanisms of multiple physiological and pathological processes. Thus, our findings provide new avenue to modulating these processes.",closed_qa
Does statin in the acute phase of ischemic stroke improve outcome after intravenous thrombolysis?,"In recent years, the medical literature has shown that statin treatment before and in the acute phase of ischemic stroke has a positive impact on outcome. The possible effect of statins during the acute phase has never been assessed in thrombolysed patients, and the few studies investigating a possible association between prior statin use and outcome after thrombolysis have reported controversial results. The aim of the present study was to assess whether statin treatment started in the acute phase of stroke (within 24h) or before stroke and continued during the acute phase may influence short- and long-term outcome in patients receiving intravenous (IV) thrombolysis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 250 patients treated with IV thrombolysis. Outcome measures were 3-month good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2); neurological improvement (reduction ≥ 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) between 24 and 72 h; and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (brain hematoma associated with NIHSS deterioration ≥ 4 points) within 72 h. Multivariate analysis showed that statin treatment started in the acute phase of stroke was associated with both good functional outcome (OR: 6.18; 95% CI: 1.43-26.62; P=0.015) and neurological improvement (OR: 9.47; 95% CI: 1.98-45.37; P=0.005), whereas statin treatment started before stroke and continued in the acute phase was associated with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR: 6.65; 95% CI: 1.58-29.12; P=0.010).","Our data suggest that statin treatment started within 24h after IV thrombolysis, but not statin treatment started before stroke and continued in the acute phase, may improve short- and long-term outcome.",closed_qa
Do nADPH oxidase subunit 4-mediated reactive oxygen species contribute to cycling hypoxia-promoted tumor progression in glioblastoma multiforme?,"Cycling and chronic tumor hypoxia are involved in tumor development and growth. However, the impact of cycling hypoxia and its molecular mechanism on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) progression remain unclear. Glioblastoma cell lines, GBM8401 and U87, and their xenografts were exposed to cycling hypoxic stress in vitro and in vivo. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in glioblastoma cells and xenografts was assayed by in vitro ROS analysis and in vivo molecular imaging studies. NADPH oxidase subunit 4 (Nox4) RNAi-knockdown technology was utilized to study the role of Nox4 in cycling hypoxia-mediated ROS production and tumor progression. Furthermore, glioblastoma cells were stably transfected with a retroviral vector bearing a dual reporter gene cassette that allowed for dynamic monitoring of HIF-1 signal transduction and tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo, using optical and nuclear imaging. Tempol, an antioxidant compound, was used to investigate the impact of ROS on cycling hypoxia-mediated HIF-1 activation and tumor progression. Glioblastoma cells and xenografts were compared under cycling hypoxic and normoxic conditions; upregulation of NOX4 expression and ROS levels were observed under cycling hypoxia in glioblastoma cells and xenografts, concomitant with increased tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, knockdown of Nox4 inhibited these effects. Moreover, in vivo molecular imaging studies demonstrated that Tempol is a good antioxidant compound for inhibiting cycling hypoxia-mediated ROS production, HIF-1 activation, and tumor growth. Immunofluorescence imaging and flow cytometric analysis for NOX4, HIF-1 activation, and Hoechst 3342 in glioblastoma also revealed high localized NOX4 expression predominantly in potentially cycling hypoxic areas with HIF-1 activation and blood perfusion within the endogenous solid tumor microenvironment.",Cycling hypoxia-induced ROS via Nox4 is a critical aspect of cancer biology to consider for therapeutic targeting of cycling hypoxia-promoted HIF-1 activation and tumor progression in GBM.,closed_qa
Is tRAIL-induced apoptosis preferentially mediated via TRAIL receptor 1 in pancreatic carcinoma cells and profoundly enhanced by XIAP inhibitors?,"We previously reported that small molecule X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) inhibitors synergize with soluble TRAIL to trigger apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Because cancers may preferentially signal via 1 of the 2 agonistic TRAIL receptors, we investigated these receptors as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer in the present study. We examined TRAIL receptor expression and cytotoxicity of specific monoclonal antibodies to TRAIL-R1 (HGS-ETR1, mapatumumab) or TRAIL-R2 (HGS-ETR2, lexatumumab) and of TRAIL receptor selective mutants alone and in combination with small molecule XIAP inhibitors in pancreatic cancer cell lines, in primary specimens, and in a xenotransplant model in vivo. The majority of primary pancreatic carcinoma samples and all cell lines express one or both agonistic TRAIL receptors. Nine of 13 cell lines are more sensitive to mapatumumab-induced apoptosis, whereas lexatumumab requires cross-linking for maximal activity. Similarly, TRAIL-R1 selective mutants display higher cytotoxicity than TRAIL-R2 selective mutants. Small molecule XIAP inhibitors preferentially act in concert with mapatumumab to trigger caspase activation, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and suppress clonogenic survival. Also, primary cultured pancreatic carcinoma cells are more susceptible to mapatumumab than lexatumumab, which is significantly enhanced by a XIAP inhibitor. Importantly, combined treatment with mapatumumab and a XIAP inhibitor cooperates to suppress tumor growth in vivo.","Mapatumumab exerts antitumor activity, especially in combination with XIAP inhibitors against most pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, whereas lexatumumab requires cross-linking for optimal cytotoxicity. These findings have important implications for the design of TRAIL-based protocols for pancreatic cancer.",closed_qa
Is there any association between parental education and child mortality?,"To assess the association between parental education and under-five mortality, using the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) data from rural Bangladesh. It also investigated whether the association of parental education with under-five mortality had changed over time. This study was nested in the IMCI cluster randomized controlled trial. Participants considered for the analysis were all children aged under five years from the baseline (1995-2000) and the final (2002-2007) IMCI household survey. The analysis sample included 39,875 and 38,544 live births from the baseline and the final survey respectively. The outcome variable was under-five mortality and the exposure variables were mother's and father's education. Data were analysed with logistic regression. In 2002-2007, the odds of the under-five mortality were 38% lower for the children with mother having secondary education, compared to the children with uneducated mother. For similar educational differences for fathers, at the same time period, the odds of the under-five mortality were 16% lower. The association of mother's education with under-five mortality was significantly stronger in 2002-2007 compared to 1995-2000.","Mother's education appears to have a strong and significant association with under-five mortality, compared to father's education.

Is hypothyroidism a Risk Factor for New-Onset Diabetes : A Cohort Study?,"To identify risk factors for the development of statin-associated diabetes mellitus (DM). The study was conducted in two phases. Phase one involved high-throughput in silico processing of a large amount of biomedical data to identify risk factors for the development of statin-associated DM. In phase two, the most prominent risk factor identified was confirmed in an observational cohort study at Clalit, the largest health care organization in Israel. Time-dependent Poisson regression multivariable models were performed to assess rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for DM occurrence. A total of 39,263 statin nonusers were matched by propensity score to 20,334 highly compliant statin initiators in 2004-2005 and followed until the end of 2010. Within 59,597 statin users and nonusers in a multivariable model, hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism carried an increased risk for DM (RR 1.53 [95% CI 1.31-1.79] and 1.75 [1.40-2.18], respectively). Hypothyroidism increased DM risk irrespective of statin treatment (RR 2.06 [1.42-2.99] and 1.66 [1.05-2.64] in statin users and nonusers, respectively). Subclinical hypothyroidism risk for DM was prominent only upon statin use (RR 1.94 [1.13-3.34] and 1.20 [0.52-2.75] in statin users and nonusers, respectively). Patients with hypothyroidism treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy were not at increased risk for DM.",Hypothyroidism is a risk factor for DM.

Does quantitative DNA methylation analysis detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasms type 3 and worse?,"DNA methylation may be used a potential biomarker for detecting cervical cancer. The authors of this report used quantitative methylation analysis of 4 genes in a full spectrum of cervical lesions to test its potential clinical application. This hospital-based, retrospective, case-control study was conducted in 185 patients and included patients who had a normal uterine cervix (n = 53), cervical intraepithelial neoplasm type 1 (CIN1) (n = 37), CIN2 (n = 22), CIN3 (n = 24), carcinoma in situ (CIS) (n = 22), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, n = 20), and adenocarcinoma (AC) (n = 7). Methylation levels of the genes sex-determining region Y, box 1 (SOX1); paired box gene 1 (PAX1); LIM homeobox transcription factor 1α (LMX1A), and NK6 transcription factor-related locus 1 (NKX6-1) were determined by using real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Cutoff values of the percentage of methylation reference (PMR) for different diagnoses were determined to test the sensitivity and specificity and to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Two-sided Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test differences in PMR between groups. The PMRs of the 4 genes were significantly higher in CIN3 and worse (CIN3+) lesions than the PMRs in specimens of normal cervix and CIN1 or CIN2 (P < .001). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting CIN3+ lesions were 0.88, 0.82, and 0.95, respectively, for SOX1; 0.78, 0.91, and 0.89, respectively, for PAX1; 0.77, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively, for LMX1A; and 0.93, 0.97, and 0.97, respectively, for NKX6-1.",The current results indicated that quantitative PCR-based testing for DNA methylation of 4 genes holds great promise for cervical cancer screening and warrants further population-based studies using standardized DNA methylation testing.,closed_qa
Is cartilage degradation fully reversible in the presence of aggrecanase but not matrix metalloproteinase activity?,"Physiological and pathophysiological cartilage turnover may coexist in articular cartilage. The distinct enzymatic processes leading to irreversible cartilage damage, compared with those needed for continuous self-repair and regeneration, remain to be identified. We investigated the capacity of repair of chondrocytes by analyzing their ability to initiate an anabolic response subsequent to three different levels of catabolic stimulation. Cartilage degradation was induced by oncostatin M and tumour necrosis factor in articular cartilage explants for 7, 11, or 17 days. The catabolic period was followed by 2 weeks of anabolic stimulation (insulin growth factor-I). Cartilage formation was assessed by collagen type II formation (PIINP). Cartilage degradation was measured by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mediated type II collagen degradation (CTX-II), and MMP and aggrecanase mediated aggrecan degradation by detecting the 342FFGVG and 374ARGSV neoepitopes. Proteoglycan turnover, content, and localization were assessed by Alcian blue. Catabolic stimulation resulted in increased levels of cartilage degradation, with maximal levels of 374ARGSV (20-fold induction), CTX-II (150-fold induction), and 342FFGVG (30-fold induction) (P < 0.01). Highly distinct protease activities were found with aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation at early stages, whereas MMP-mediated aggrecan and collagen degradation occurred during later stages. Anabolic treatment increased proteoglycan content at all time points (maximally, 250%; P < 0.001). By histology, we found a complete replenishment of glycosaminoglycan at early time points and pericellular localization at an intermediate time point. In contrast, only significantly increased collagen type II formation (200%; P < 0.01) was observed at early time points.","Cartilage degradation was completely reversible in the presence of high levels of aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation.

We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study. The study took place at Bambui city, Minas Gerais State, Southeast Brazil. A total of 1408 (87.7%) cohort participants had complete information on the MMSE and health measures. The association between each of five dimensions (concentration, language/praxis, orientation, attention, and memory) underlying the MMSE and APOE ε4 allele was assessed using multivariate linear regression models. Potential confounding variables included sociodemographic factors and selected biomarkers. The main finding is a strong negative association between the presence of APOE ε4 allele and memory dimension in the MMSE (fully adjusted β coefficient = -0.14; 95% confidence interval: -0.27 to -0.04; p = 0.016).

"Are the MAOA , COMT , MTHFR and ESR1 gene polymorphisms associated with the risk of depression in menopausal women?","The aim of the study was assessment of a possible relationship between the polymorphisms of the candidate genes participating in the etiology of some neurological and psychiatric disorders and the risk of depression in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. A total of 167 (54 perimenopausal and 113 postmenopausal) Caucasian women from western Poland, aged 42-67, were recruited as the patient group in the study because of depressive symptoms, and another 321 healthy women (102 perimenopausal and 219 postmenopausal) served as the controls. All study participants were evaluated for climacteric and depressive disorders according to the Kupperman index and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HRSD), respectively. The following candidate genes were selected for the study: 5HTR2A, 5HTR1B, 5HTR2C, TPH1, TPH2, MAOA, COMT, NET, GABRB1, ESR1, MTHFR, MTR and MTHFD1. In each group the frequencies of the polymorphisms were determined using PCR-RFLP analysis. After correcting for Bonferroni multiple tests, we found associations between the MAOA c.1460C>T (SNP 1137070), COMT c.472G>A (SNP 4680), MTHFR c.677C>T (SNP 1801133) and ESR1 454(-351) A>G (SNP 9340799) polymorphisms to mild and moderate depressive symptoms in menopausal women. In the perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, genotype association of the MAOA c.1460 CT and c.1460 CT+TT (OR=1.83; pcorr=0.009 and OR=1.85; pcorr=0.003, resp.), and of the MTHFR c.677 TT and c.677 CT+TT (OR=3.52; pcorr=0.00009 and OR=2.06; pcorr=0.0006, resp.), as well as of the COMT c.472 GA and COMT c.472 GA+AA genotypes (OR=2.23; pcorr=0.03 and OR=2.17; pcorr=0.027, resp.) in the postmenopausal women revealed significantly higher frequencies of these variants in depressed female patients than in controls, whereas the ESR1 454(-351) AG and 454(-351) AG+GG genotypes were associated with lower risk of depression in postmenopausal women (OR=0.48; pcorr=0.012, and OR=0.52; pcorr=0.015, resp.).",Our study substantiates the involvement of the MAOA and MTHFR polymorphisms in climacteric depression and offers evidence that the COMT and ESR1 genes may also play a role in the susceptibility to depressive mood in postmenopausal women.,closed_qa
Evaluation of cardiovascular risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: do cardiovascular biomarkers offer added predictive ability over established clinical risk scores?,"To determine whether adding C-reactive protein, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, rheumatoid factor, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), or anti-apolipoprotein A-I (anti-Apo A-I) IgG to the Framingham 10-year cardiovascular (CV) risk score (FRS) could improve its CV prognostic accuracy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed an ancillary study derived from a prospective single-center cohort consisting of 118 RA patients without CV disease at baseline. The FRS and the various biomarkers were assessed at enrollment and their prognostic accuracy was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The incremental predictive ability of biomarkers was assessed using the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) statistics. During a median followup period of 9 years, the incidence of CV events was 16%. Both the FRS and 3 of the biomarkers (NT-proBNP, ox-LDL, and anti-Apo A-I) were significant predictors of subsequent CV events (area under the ROC curve [AUC] between 0.68 and 0.73). Anti-Apo A-I was the only biomarker to significantly improve the prognostic ability of the FRS, with AUCs increasing from 0.72 to 0.81 and the IDI improving by 175% (P<0.001).","Among the biomarkers tested, only anti-Apo A-I significantly improved the FRS predictive ability.",closed_qa
Does gut barrier impairment by high-fat diet in mice depend on housing conditions?,"Diet-induced obesity (DIO) is proposed to cause impairments in intestinal barrier integrity, but contradictory results have been published and it appears that the outcomes depend on other environmental factors. We therefore assessed whether the hygienic status of animal facilities alters the gut barrier in DIO mice. Male C57BL/6N mice were housed in a conventional (CV) or a specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility and were fed identical diets represented by a high-fat (60kJ% fat) or control diet (11kJ% fat) for 12 wks. Intestinal barrier function in small and large intestine was evaluated in Ussing chambers by electrical resistance and permeability measurements. Jejunal (p < 0.01) and proximal colonic (p < 0.05) barrier function was altered in CV DIO mice, but not in SPF DIO mice. Moreover, only CV DIO mice were characterized by metabolic endotoxemia and low-grade inflammation. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant differences in fecal bacterial diversity and composition between the two animal facilities, but only in mice fed the HFD. Moreover, cecal DCA concentrations correlated positively with two yet uncultivated Clostridiales species.",We demonstrated that housing conditions and associated changes in gut bacterial colonization are pivotal for maintenance of gut barrier integrity in DIO mice.,closed_qa
Does geometric morphometrics define shape differences in the cortical area map of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred mice?,"We previously described planar areal differences in adult mouse visual, somatosensory, and neocortex that collectively discriminated C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred strain identity. Here we use a novel application of established methods of two-dimensional geometric morphometrics to examine shape differences in the cortical area maps of these inbred strains. We used Procrustes superimposition to align a reliable set of landmarks in the plane of the cortical sheet from tangential sections stained for the cytochrome oxidase enzyme. Procrustes superimposition translates landmark configurations to a common origin, scales them to a common size, and rotates them to minimize an estimate of error. Remaining variation represents shape differences. We compared the variation in shape between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J relative to that within each strain using a permutation test of Goodall's F statistic. Significant differences in shape in the posterior medial barrel subfield (PMBSF), as well as differences in shape across primary sensory areas, characterize the cortical area maps of these common inbred, isogenic strains.","C57BL/6J and DBA/2J have markedly different cortical area maps, in both size and shape. These differences suggest polymorphism in genetic factors underlying cortical specification, even between common isogenic strains. Comparing cortical phenotypes between normally varying inbred mice or between genetically modified mice can identify genetic contributions to cortical specification. Geometric morphometric analysis of shape represents an additional quantitative tool for the study of cortical development, regardless of whether it is studied from phenotype to gene or gene to phenotype.",closed_qa
"Is cyt1Aa protein from Bacillus thuringiensis ( Berliner ) serovar israelensis active against the Mediterranean fruit fly , Ceratitis capitata ( Wiedemann )?","Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) is one of the world's most destructive fruit pests. The aim of this study was to ascertain insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) delta-endotoxins to C. capitata. Among 42 selected Bacillus strains, only B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) solubilised protoxins showed biological activity against C. capitata neonate larvae, whereas Bti spore and crystal mixture was inactive. Insecticidal activity of Bti protoxins was significantly enhanced by incubation with Culex pipiens L. gut extracts. Overdigestion of Bti protoxins with Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) gut extracts suppressed biological activity against C. capitata, and this correlated with degradation of Cyt toxins. Cyt1Aa solubilised protoxin showed the highest toxicity, LC(50) after 7 days of 4.93 microg cm(-2), while proteolytical processing of Cyt1Aa protoxins by larval gut extracts did not enhance insecticidal activity.",The present study provides evidence for the first time of the insecticidal activity of a B. thuringiensis strain against C. capitata and identifies a single delta-endotoxin with potential for controlling this pest.,closed_qa
Does interleukin-1 receptor antagonist attenuate tumor necrosis factor-induced alterations in wound breaking strength?,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important mediator of impaired wound healing during sepsis. To determine whether the inhibitory effects of systemic TNF on wound healing are mediated directly by TNF or by means of the induction of interleukin-1 (IL-1), we investigated the effects of TNF and interleukin- receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) on wound healing in healthy rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized, and jugular catheters were placed. After recovery of 48 hours, osmotic minipumps were inserted into the peritoneal cavity and polyvinyl alcohol implants were placed subcutaneously. Control rats were infused with saline (24 microL/day, i.p., and 15 mL/day, i.v.). TNF rats received TNF i.p. (100 microg/kg per day) and saline i.v. (15 mL/day). TNF+IL-1ra rats received TNF i.p. (100 microg/kg per day) and IL-1ra i.v. (2 mg/kg per day;15 mL/day). All animals were pair fed to the TNF group. On day 6, the wounds were harvested. The breaking strength of the abdominal incision was measured. Granulation tissue penetration and quality were determined by scoring polyvinyl alcohol implant histology from 1 to 4 in a blinded manner. Collagen deposition in polyvinyl alcohol implants was quantified by hydroxyproline assay. TNF decreased the breaking strength of incisional wounds to 40% of control levels (p < 0.001). IL-1ra restored the breaking strength of incisions from TNF-infused animals to 80% of control levels. Similar reductions in granulation tissue penetration, quality, and hydroxyproline content were observed in TNF-treated animals and were partially ameliorated by IL-1ra.",IL-1ra significantly attenuates the inhibitory effects of systemic TNF on wound healing. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of TNF on cutaneous tissue repair are mediated in part by IL-1.,closed_qa
Is low dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke among women?,"Previous research suggests greater risk of coronary heart disease with lower levels of the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). No studies have examined the association between DHEAS and risk of ischemic stroke. DHEAS may influence ischemic stroke risk through atherosclerotic-related mechanisms (endothelial function and smooth muscle cell proliferation) or insulin resistance. Between 1989 and 1990, 32 826 women without prior stroke in the Nurses' Health Study, an observational cohort, provided blood samples and were followed up for cardiovascular events. Among this sample, using a nested case-control design, 461 ischemic strokes were confirmed by medical records by 2006. Cases were matched to controls free of stroke at the time of the index case and by age, race, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, smoking status, and date of sample collection. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used. Median DHEAS levels did not differ between cases (median=58.7) and controls (median=66.0; P=0.10). Conditional on matching factors, the lowest DHEAS quartile exhibited a relative risk of 1.30 for ischemic stroke (95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.94), compared with the highest quartile and marginally unchanged when adjusted for confounders (relative risk=1.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-2.02). When modeled as a binary variable dichotomized at the lowest quartile, women with low DHEAS (≤the lowest quartile) had a significantly increased multivariable adjusted risk of ischemic stroke compared with those with higher levels (relative risk=1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.92).","Lower DHEAS levels were associated with a greater risk of ischemic stroke, even after adjustment for potential confounders. These novel observations warrant confirmation in other populations.",closed_qa
Is normal bronchial responsiveness in asthmatics a reliable index for withdrawing inhaled corticosteroid treatment?,"Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment is first-line maintenance therapy in bronchial asthma. However, it is not clear whether and when ICS treatment can be withdrawn. The aim of this open study was to assess whether normalization of bronchial responsiveness could be used as a reliable index to assess the opportunity of ICS treatment withdrawal. Open study at two different points in time. Outpatient pulmonary clinic. Eighteen asthmatic subjects. ICS therapy was withdrawn in subjects treated with beclomethasone dipropionate, at the maintenance dose of 889+/-246 microg/d for>3 months. Upon recruitment, all subjects were asymptomatic, had FEV1>70% of predicted value, and were in treatment with beta2-agonists on an as-needed basis. Eight subjects (group 1) had normal bronchial responsiveness (methacholine provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 [PD20]>2,000 microg) and 10 subjects (group 2) had bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) (PD20<or = 2,000 microg). After withdrawal of ICS treatment, subjects were followed up for 3 weeks and were asked to record their asthma symptoms (cough, dyspnea, and wheezing) and their beta2-agonist use. At recruitment and at the end of follow-up, subjects underwent spirometry and a methacholine challenge test. Frequency of asthma exacerbation was similar in subjects with normal bronchial responsiveness (NBR) and in subjects with BHR (50% vs 60%), but subjects with NBR tended to remain asymptomatic for longer than those with BHR (mean+/-SD, 10.7+/-4.4 days vs 5.5+/-3.8 days) (p=0.08). None of the subjects reported any condition that could have triggered exacerbation. Asthma exacerbation was associated with a significant decrease in FEV1 (-105+/-107 mL; p<0.05) and in PD20 (-1,332+/-1,020 microg; p<0.001).","Our study shows that the likelihood of asthma exacerbation is not reduced if ICS treatment is withdrawn when the subjects have NBR, but the exacerbation could be delayed. Further studies in larger populations of asthmatics are needed to confirm these findings.",closed_qa
Does non-muscle myosin II regulate neuronal actin dynamics by interacting with guanine nucleotide exchange factors?,"Non-muscle myosin II (NM II) regulates a wide range of cellular functions, including neuronal differentiation, which requires precise spatio-temporal activation of Rho GTPases. The molecular mechanism underlying the NM II-mediated activation of Rho GTPases is poorly understood. The present study explored the possibility that NM II regulates neuronal differentiation, particularly morphological changes in growth cones and the distal axon, through guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of the Dbl family. NM II colocalized with GEFs, such as βPIX, kalirin and intersectin, in growth cones. Inactivation of NM II by blebbistatin (BBS) led to the increased formation of short and thick filopodial actin structures at the periphery of growth cones. In line with these observations, FRET analysis revealed enhanced Cdc42 activity in BBS-treated growth cones. BBS treatment also induced aberrant targeting of various GEFs to the distal axon where GEFs were seldom observed under physiological conditions. As a result, numerous protrusions and branches were generated on the shaft of the distal axon. The disruption of the NM II-GEF interactions by overexpression of the DH domains of βPIX or Tiam1, or by βPIX depletion with specific siRNAs inhibited growth cone formation and induced slender axons concomitant with multiple branches in cultured hippocampal neurons. Finally, stimulation with nerve growth factor induced transient dissociation of the NM II-GEF complex, which was closely correlated with the kinetics of Cdc42 and Rac1 activation.",Our results suggest that NM II maintains proper morphology of neuronal growth cones and the distal axon by regulating actin dynamics through the GEF-Rho GTPase signaling pathway.,closed_qa
Does single-dose sufentanil or fentanyl reduce agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing ophthalmology surgery?,"The trail investigated the effect of small dose sufentanil or fentanyl administrated before the end of surgery in reducing the incidence of emergence agitation after anesthesia with sevoflurane in preschool children undergoing ophthalmology surgery, and the incidence of emergence agitation of sevoflurane anesthesia. From September 2011 to January 2012 January, ninety ASA I-II children, aged from 3-7 years, undergoing ophthalmology surgery in West China Hospital, were randomly assigned to three groups to receive intravenous saline, sufentanil 0.1μg/kg or fentanyl 1μg/kg at 20 minutes before the end of the surgery. Children were scored by scoring system for emergence agitation (SSEA), Children's and Infants' Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) score. The incidence of agitation was 30% in sufentanil group, 36.67% in fentanyl group, and 63.33% in control group. The incidence of sever agitation (SSEA score≥3) was 6.67% in sufentanil group, 23.37% in fentanyl group, and 36.67% in control group. The agitation and pain scores in sufentanil group and fentanyl group were better than those in control group (P<0.05). There was no difference among three groups about time to extubation.","We conclude that the incidence of emergence agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing ophthalmology surgery is up to 63.33%. The single dose of sufentanil or fentanyl can reduce the emergence agitation in children anesthesized with sevoflurane, with no adverse effects.

Can new inflammatory markers improve the diagnosis of acute appendicitis?,"The diagnosis of appendicitis is difficult and resource consuming. New inflammatory markers have been proposed for the diagnosis of appendicitis, but their utility in combination with traditional diagnostic variables has not been tested. Our objective is to explore the potential of new inflammatory markers for improving the diagnosis of appendicitis. The diagnostic properties of the six most promising out of 21 new inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-6, chemokine ligand [CXCL]-8, chemokine C-C motif ligand [CCL]-2, serum amyloid A [SAA], matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-9, and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) were compared with traditional diagnostic variables included in the Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score (right iliac fossa pain, vomiting, rebound tenderness, guarding, white blood cell [WBC] count, proportion neutrophils, C-reactive protein and body temperature) in 432 patients with suspected appendicitis by uni- and multivariable regression models. Of the new inflammatory variables, SAA, MPO, and MMP9 were the strongest discriminators for all appendicitis (receiver operating characteristics [ROC] 0.71) and SAA was the strongest discriminator for advanced appendicitis (ROC 0.80) compared with defence or rebound tenderness, which were the strongest traditional discriminators for all appendicitis (ROC 0.84) and the WBC count for advanced appendicitis (ROC 0.89). CCL2 was the strongest independent discriminator beside the AIR score variables in a multivariable model. The AIR score had an ROC area of 0.91 and could correctly classify 58.3 % of the patients, with an accuracy of 92.9 %. This was not improved by inclusion of the new inflammatory markers.","The conventional diagnostic variables for appendicitis, as combined in the AIR score, is an efficient screening instrument for classifying patients as low-, indeterminate-, or high-risk for appendicitis. The addition of the new inflammatory variables did not improve diagnostic performance further.",closed_qa
"Does dOCA-salt hypertension require the ouabain-sensitive binding site of the α2 Na , K-ATPase?","We have shown that the ouabain-sensitive α2 Na,K-ATPase is required for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced hypertension and gestational blood pressure regulation. It is therefore of interest to explore whether this binding site participates in the development of other forms of hypertension, such as deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt using mutant mice with altered sensitivity to ouabain. Wild-type (α1 ouabain-resistant, α2 ouabain-sensitive: α(R/R)α2(S/S)), α1-resistant, α2-resistant (α1(R/R)α2(R/R)) and α1-sensitive, α2-resistant (α1(S/S)α2(R/R)) mice were uninephrectomized and implanted with DOCA pellets. The animals were given either tap water or 1% NaCl, and blood pressure was measured before and after DOCA. DOCA-salt-treated α1(R/R)α2(R/R) mice developed hypertension to the same extent as α1(R/R)α2(S/S) mice (wild type), and the α1(S/S)α2(R/R) mice given DOCA-salt also showed no difference from the other two genotypes. The expression of the α1 isoform was not changed by DOCA-salt treatment in either α1(R/R)α2(S/S) or α1(R/R)α2(R/R) mice. However, the α2 subunit was expressed at substantially higher levels in the hearts of α1(R/R)α2(R/R) than α1(R/R)α2(S/S) mice, regardless of treatment. Plasma levels of ouabain did not change consistently, but those of marinobufagenin were modestly higher in DOCA-salt treated mice relatively to those without salt.","The ouabain-binding site of either the α1 or α2 Na,K-ATPase subunit does not play an essential role in the development of DOCA-salt hypertension in this mouse model. These findings indicate that the underlying mechanisms of hypertension induced by DOCA-salt treatment are different from those of ACTH-induced hypertension.",closed_qa
Is oxygen a key factor in the lipodystrophy phenotype?,"The lipodystrophic syndrome (LD) is a disorder resulting from selective damage of adipose tissue by antiretroviral drugs included in therapy controlling human-immunodeficiency-virus-1. In the therapy cocktail the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) contribute to the development of this syndrome. Cellular target of NRTI was identified as the mitochondrial polymerase-gamma and their toxicity described as a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion resulting in a mitochondrial cytopathy and involved in fat redistribution. No mechanisms offer explanation whatsoever for the lipo-atrophic and lipo-hypertrophic phenotype of LD. To understand the occurrence we proposed that the pO2 (oxygen partial pressure) could be a key factor in the development of the LD. For the first time, we report here differential effects of NRTIs on human adipose cells depending on pO2 conditions. We showed that the hypoxia conditions could alter adipogenesis process by modifying expression of adipocyte makers as leptin and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARgamma and inhibiting triglyceride (TG) accumulation in adipocytes. Toxicity of NRTI followed on adipose cells in culture under normoxia versus hypoxia conditions showed, differential effects of drugs on mtDNA of these cells depending on pO2 conditions. Moreover, NRTI-treated adipocytes were refractory to the inhibition of adipogenesis under hypoxia. Finally, our hypothesis that variations of pO2 could exist between adipose tissue from anatomical origins was supported by staining of the hypoxic-induced angiopoietin ANGPTL4 depended on the location of fat.","Toxicity of NRTIs have been shown to be opposite on human adipose cells depending on the oxygen availability. These data suggest that the LD phenotype may be a differential consequence of NRTI effects, depending on the metabolic status of the targeted adipose tissues and provide new insights into the opposite effects of antiretroviral treatment, as observed for the lipo-atrophic and lipo-hypertrophic phenotype characteristic of LD.",closed_qa
Does modification of the Tet-On regulatory system prevent the conditional-live HIV-1 variant from losing doxycycline-control?,"We have previously constructed a doxycycline (dox)-dependent HIV-1 variant by incorporating the Tet-On gene regulatory system into the viral genome. Replication of this HIV-rtTA virus is driven by the dox-inducible transactivator protein rtTA, and can be switched on and off at will. We proposed this conditional-live virus as a novel vaccine approach against HIV-1. Upon vaccination, replication of HIV-rtTA can be temporarily activated by transient dox administration and controlled to the extent needed for optimal induction of the immune system. However, subsequent dox-withdrawal may impose a selection for virus variants with reduced dox-dependence. We simulated this on/off switching of virus replication in multiple, independent cultures and could indeed select for HIV-rtTA variants that replicated without dox. Nearly all evolved variants had acquired a typical amino acid substitution at position 56 in the rtTA protein. We developed a novel rtTA variant that blocks this undesired evolutionary route and thus prevents HIV-rtTA from losing dox-control.",The loss of dox-control observed upon evolution of the dox-dependent HIV-1 variant was effectively blocked by modification of the Tet-On regulatory system.,closed_qa
Is preoperative Duplex Scanning a Helpful Diagnostic Tool in Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome?,"To evaluate the diagnostic role of venous and arterial duplex scanning in neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS). Retrospective review of patients who underwent duplex ultrasonography prior to first rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS) for NTOS from 2005 to 2013. Abnormal scans included ipsilateral compression (IC) with abduction of the symptomatic extremity (>50% change in subclavian vessel flow), contralateral (asymptomatic side) compression (CC) or bilateral compression (BC). A total of 143 patients (76% female, average age 34, range 13-59) underwent bilateral preoperative duplex scanning. Ipsilateral compression was seen in 44 (31%), CC in 12 (8%), and BC in 14 (10%). Seventy-three (51%) patients demonstrated no compression. Patients with IC more often experienced intraoperative pneumothoraces (49% vs. 25%, P < .05) and had positive Adson tests (86% vs. 61%, P < .02).",Compression of the subclavian vein or artery on duplex ultrasonography can assist in NTOS diagnosis.

Do osteoprotegerin levels predict mortality in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis?,"To examine the prognostic value of osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels in relation to all-cause mortality in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). We measured plasma OPG levels in 136 patients with symptomatic severe AS and investigated associations with transvalvular gradients, valve area, valve calcification (using ultrasonic backscatter analysis as an estimate) and measures of heart failure. Then, we assessed the prognostic value of elevated plasma OPG in determining all-cause mortality (n = 29) in these patients. Elevated OPG was poorly correlated with the degree of AS but was associated with increased backscatter measurements and impaired cardiac function. Furthermore, OPG was associated with all-cause mortality in patients with symptomatic AS, even after adjustment for conventional risk markers. The strongest association was obtained by using a combination of high levels of both OPG and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), suggesting that these markers may reflect distinct pathways in the development and progression of AS.",The level of circulating OPG is significantly associated with all-cause mortality alone and in combination with NT-proBNP in patients with severe symptomatic AS.,closed_qa
Does bone mineral density remain stable in HAART-treated HIV-infected men over 2 years?,"Recently we reported that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Caucasian men treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have normal weight-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD), in contrast to most other cross-sectional analyses, which have reported low BMD in HIV-infected patients. We have now addressed the question of whether there is accelerated BMD loss over time in HIV-infected men. A 2-year, prospective, longitudinal study. Twenty-three HAART-treated, HIV-infected men and 26 healthy controls. All participants had measurements of BMD and bone-related laboratory parameters at baseline, and a repeat measurement of BMD at 2 years. In the HIV-infected men the mean age was 47 years, the mean duration of infection was 8.2 years, and the mean duration of HAART was 54 months. Over 2 years of follow-up, BMD increased from baseline in the HIV-infected men by 2.6% at the lumbar spine (P = 0.05 vs. baseline), and remained stable at the total hip (mean change 0.1%, P > 0.99) and total body (mean change 0.6%, P = 0.39). Mean changes in BMD in the control group were 1.4% at the lumbar spine, -0.1% at the total hip, and -0.8% at the total body. The HIV-infected men lost less total body BMD than the control group (P = 0.01). In the HIV-infected men, body weight remained stable over 2 years while fat mass decreased and lean mass tended to increase, whereas in the controls, body weight and fat mass increased while lean mass remained stable.",Accelerated bone loss does not occur in HIV-infected men treated with HAART.

"Are serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 increased in dyspeptic patients with Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis?","Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a non-invasive microorganism causing intense gastric mucosal inflammatory and immune reaction. H. pylori-induced gastric mucosal cytokine overproduction has been clearly documented previously. The stomach has a large surface area and continuous spill-over of locally produced cytokines into the blood stream is a possibility. There are few and conflicting data on circulatory proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with H. pylori infection. Forty-two dyspeptic patients were enrolled into the study. The presence of H. pylori infection was diagnosed with antral histopathologic examination. After overnight fasting; serum samples were obtained from each patient to determine circulating interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. H. pylori was shown in 30 cases using Giemsa stain in antral histopathologic evaluation. Twelve cases were negative for H. pylori staining. Both the age and sex distribution had an insignificant difference in both H pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative groups. The mean circulatory levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a in both groups were not different. The situation was same in respect to the serum levels of these cytokines and the degree of inflammation, H. pylori density and activation scores according to Sydney classification.","We could not show elevated circulatory levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha in H. pylori-infected cases. We believe that H. pylori-related cytokine activation become concentrated on gastric mucosa and this pathogen-induced local inflammatory cascade does not cause changes in circulatory levels of these cytokines. Moreover, there is no correlation between the levels of serum cytokines and Sydney parameters.",closed_qa
Does cFH Y402H confer similar risk of soft drusen and both forms of advanced AMD?,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible visual impairment in the developed world. The two forms of advanced AMD, geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD, represent different pathological processes in the macula that lead to loss of central vision. Soft drusen, characterized by deposits in the macula without visual loss, are considered to be a precursor of advanced AMD. Recently, it has been proposed that a common missense variant, Y402H, in the Complement Factor H (CFH) gene increases the risk for advanced AMD. However, its impact on soft drusen, GA, or neovascular AMD--or the relationship between them--is unclear. We genotyped 581 Icelandic patients with advanced AMD (278 neovascular AMD, 203 GA, and 100 with mixed neovascular AMD/GA), and 435 with early AMD (of whom 220 had soft drusen). A second cohort of 431 US patients from Utah, 322 with advanced AMD (244 neovascular AMD and 78 GA) and 109 early-AMD cases with soft drusen, were analyzed. We confirmed that the CFH Y402H variant shows significant association to advanced AMD, with odds ratio of 2.39 in Icelandic patients (p = 5.9 x 10(-12)) and odds ratio of 2.14 in US patients from Utah (p = 2.0 x 10(-9)) with advanced AMD. Furthermore, we show that the Y402H variant confers similar risk of soft drusen and both forms of advanced AMD (GA or neovascular AMD).","Soft drusen occur prior to progression to advanced AMD and represent a histological feature shared by neovascular AMD and GA. Our results suggest that CFH is a major risk factor of soft drusen, and additional genetic factors and/or environmental factors may be required for progression to advanced AMD.",closed_qa
Do physical performance and a test of gaze stabilization in older adults?,"The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of a standardized gaze stabilization test (GST) as an indicator of vestibular function in community-dwelling older adults and to examine the relationship between gaze stabilization and physical performance. Descriptive, cross-sectional. Tertiary medical center. Eighty-six healthy older adults (22 men) of mean (standard deviation [SD]) age 76.8 (5.8) years were recruited from the Pittsburgh community. Performance on the GST, measures of physical performance (standing balance, chair rises, and gait speed individually and combined into the Short Physical Performance Battery) and self-reported balance. Whereas more than 90% of participants completed testing in the pitch and yaw planes, only 85% (73 of 86) had interpretable scores due to prolonged perception time independent of vestibulo-ocular reflex. The mean (SD) head movement velocity in the pitch plane was 94.5 (26.7) degrees per second, whereas the mean (SD) head movement velocity in the yaw plane was 95.5 (29.3) degrees per second. There was a strong association between age and GST performance in the pitch and yaw planes (r = 0.68; p < 0.001). Poor GST performance in the yaw plane was associated with balance capacity with eyes closed. Additionally, there was a trend toward an association between self-reported balance and GST performance in both pitch (p = 0.08) and yaw planes (p = 0.10).","Although most older adults completed GST testing, estimates were not interpretable in almost 15% due to prolonged perception time. Gaze stabilization test in the yaw plane was worse than previously reported in healthy older adults and was associated with poor ability to balance with eyes closed. Self-reported balance tended to be associated with an objective assessment of vestibulo-ocular reflex in this population of older adults.",closed_qa
Is colonoscopic polyp detection rate stable throughout the workday including evening colonoscopy sessions?,"Polyp detection rate (PDR) is an accepted measure of colonoscopy quality. Several factors may influence PDR including time of procedure and order of colonoscopy within a session. Our unit provides evening colonoscopy lists (6-9 pm). We examined whether colonoscopy performance declines in the evening. Data for all National Health Service (NHS) outpatient colonoscopies performed at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in 2011 were examined. Timing, demographics, indication and colonoscopy findings were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate regression. Data from 2576 colonoscopies were included: 1163 (45.1%) in the morning, 1123 (43.6%) in the afternoon and 290 (11.3%) in the evening.  Overall PDR was 40.80%. Males, increasing age and successful caecal intubation were all significantly associated with higher polyp detection. The indications 'faecal occult blood screening' (p<0.001) and 'polyp surveillance' (p<0.001) were strongly positively associated and 'anaemia' (p=0.01) was negatively associated with PDR. Following adjustment for  covariates, there was no significant difference in PDR between sessions. With the morning as the reference value, the odds ratio for polyp detection in the afternoon and evening were 0.93 (95% CI = 0.72-1.18) and 1.15 (95%CI = 0.82-1.61) respectively. PDR was not affected by rank of colonoscopy within a list, sedation dose or trainee-involvement.","Time of day did not affect polyp detection rate in clinical practice. Evening colonoscopy had equivalent efficacy and is an effective tool in meeting increasing demands for endoscopy. Standardisation was shown to have a considerable effect as demographics, indication and endoscopist varied substantially between sessions. Evening sessions were popular with a younger population.",closed_qa
Is prediabetes associated with a high-risk colorectal adenoma?,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia. However, association between prediabetes and colorectal adenoma has not been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between prediabetes and the presence of colorectal adenomas. Consecutive prediabetic subjects who underwent screening colonoscopy were enrolled at Kyung Hee University Hospital in Gangdong, Seoul, Korea, between June 2006 and May 2012. Non-prediabetic subjects were separately pooled from the database of the Center for Health Promotion between January 2012 and May 2012. Prediabetes was defined according to the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association. The prevalence of colorectal adenomas and their characteristics were compared between prediabetic and non-prediabetic groups. The prevalence of colorectal adenoma was higher in prediabetic subjects than in non-prediabetic subjects (39.6 vs. 30.6 %, respectively, p = 0.019). Prediabetic subjects had more multiple and high-risk adenomas than the control group in non-matched analysis (p = 0.000, respectively). In age-matched analysis, the prevalence of multiple and high-risk adenomas were significantly higher in a prediabetic group than those in a control group (44.4 vs. 28.4 %, p = 0.034; 51.9 vs. 34.6 %, p = 0.026, respectively). Furthermore, prediabetes (odds ratio = 2.198; 95 % confidence interval = 1.042-4.637; p = 0.039) was found to be an independent risk factor for a high-risk adenoma by multivariate analysis.","The prevalence of multiple and high-risk colorectal adenomas is significantly higher in the prediabetic subjects than those in the control group.

Does pre-intervention cerebral blood volume predict outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke?,"Pre-intervention perfusion imaging is increasingly becoming part of stroke triage. Small studies supporting imaging based patient selection have been published. The goal of this larger study was to determine if perfusion imaging could impact on functional outcomes in patients undergoing stroke interventions. All patients who had undergone endovascular therapy for anterior circulation strokes over a 7 year period were retrospectively analyzed. The pre-intervention perfusion imaging was assessed for size of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow and mean transit time (MTT) abnormalities. A perfusion mismatch for irreversible versus reversible ischemia was based on CBV and MTT. Clinical outcome and mortality were based on the 90 day modified Rankin Scale. An analysis of the pre-intervention perfusion parameters was then performed to determine any impact on functional outcomes. 110 patients underwent endovascular therapy for anterior circulation strokes. A younger age and lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were important clinical predictors of favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2). The extent of the CBV abnormality and percentage of CBV/MTT mismatch were the strongest imaging predictors of outcome and mortality. A CBV area of 229.5 mm(2) (± 290) was seen for favorable outcomes versus 968 mm(2) (± 1173) for poor outcomes (p<0.0001). A CBV/MTT mismatch of 91% (± 10.7) was seen for favorable outcomes versus 72.5% (± 31.6) for poor outcomes (p=0.0001). The CBV area was 273 mm(2) (± 392) in patients without mortality versus 1401.1 mm(2) (± 1310) in patients with mortality (p<0.0001). Patients who survived had a mean CBV/MTT mismatch of 90.2% (± 12.5) versus 61.1% (± 35.2) for those who did not (p<0.0001). A CBV lesion approximately greater than one-third of the middle cerebral artery distribution predicted a poor outcome and mortality.",The extent of pre-intervention CBV abnormality is a strong predictor of functional outcomes following endovascular stroke therapy.

Do implantation of primary cultured adipocytes that secrete insulin modifies blood glucose levels in diabetic mice?,"In type 1 diabetic patients, basal insulin supplementation plays a central role in tight glycaemic control. Therefore, safe and steady supplementation of basal insulin is strongly desirable, despite the need for multiple injections. The aim of this study was to investigate a procedure for supplementation using genetically engineered, primary-cultured adipocytes in diabetic mice. Furin-cleavable human proinsulin cDNA was transferred into murine primary-cultured adipocytes using a retroviral vector. The cells were implanted subcutaneously into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The transfected cells secreted substantial amounts of mature insulin, as well as C-peptide, into conditioned medium. Syngeneic implantation of the cells significantly improved hyperglycaemia and blood HbA(1)c concentrations in a manner that was dependent on cell number, without causing hypoglycaemia. The plasma insulin concentration was dependent on the implanted cell number, and the systemic effect of the circulating insulin was confirmed by marked improvement of body weight reduction and liver glycogen content. Additionally, surgical resection of the implants, in which the insulin secretion was immunologically confirmed after transplantation, diminished the glucose-lowering effect, suggesting that in vivo expression could be eliminated if necessary.",These results indicate that the autotransplantation of functionalised adipocytes may lead to a clinical application in the treatment of diabetes.,closed_qa
Is overweight/obesity associated with short sleep duration in older women?,"No study to date has documented the association between short sleep duration and the risk for obesity in older people. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional associations between short sleep duration and variations in body fat indices in older women. Anthropometric and body composition measurements, resting energy expenditure, daily energy expenditure, daily energy intake, plasma lipid-lipoprotein profile, and self-reported sleep duration were determined in a sample of 90 women of 50 years and above. The odds ratios for overweight/obesity were comparable in subjects reporting<7 hours and>or=7 hours of sleep per day, with or without adjustment for age, daily energy expenditure and daily energy intake. The results did not permit to observe any significant difference between the two sleeper groups for all the variables investigated. The correlations between sleep duration and adiposity indices were also non significant.","Short sleep duration does not predict an increased risk of being overweight/obese in older women. This observation, together with our previously reported results in younger subjects, suggests that the sleep-body fat relationship progressively becomes less detectable with increasing in age.",closed_qa
Are cerebrospinal Fluid Markers of Alzheimer 's Disease Pathology and Microglial Activation Associated with Altered White Matter Microstructure in Asymptomatic Adults at Risk for Alzheimer 's Disease?,"The immune response in Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves activation of microglia which may remove amyloid-β (Aβ). However, overproduction of inflammatory compounds may exacerbate neural damage in AD. AD pathology accumulates years before diagnosis, yet the extent to which neuroinflammation is involved in the earliest disease stages is unknown. To determine whether neuroinflammation exacerbates neural damage in preclinical AD. We utilized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging collected in 192 asymptomatic late-middle-aged adults (mean age = 60.98 years). Neuroinflammatory markers chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in CSF were utilized as markers of neuroinflammation. Neural cell damage was assessed using CSF neurofilament light chain protein (NFL), CSF total tau (T-Tau), and neural microstructure assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). With regard to AD pathology, CSF Aβ42 and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-Tau181) were used as markers of amyloid and tau pathology, respectively. We hypothesized that higher YKL-40 and MCP-1 in the presence of AD pathology would be associated with higher NFL, T-Tau, and altered microstructure on DTI. Neuroinflammation was associated with markers of neural damage. Higher CSF YKL-40 was associated with both higher CSF NFL and T-Tau. Inflammation interacted with AD pathology, such that greater MCP-1 and lower Aβ42 was associated with altered microstructure in bilateral frontal and right temporal lobe and that greater MCP-1 and greater P-Tau181 was associated with altered microstructure in precuneus.",Inflammation may play a role in neural damage in preclinical AD.,closed_qa
Does telomere length in elderly Caucasians weakly correlate with blood cell counts?,"Age-related decrease in bone marrow erythropoietic capacity is often accompanied by the telomere length shortening in peripheral white blood cells. However, limited and conflicting data hamper the conclusive opinion regarding this relationship. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess an association between telomere length and peripheral blood cell count parameters in the Polish elderly population. The substudy included 1573 of 4981 subjects aged 65 years or over, participants of the population-based PolSenior study. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated from blood mononuclear cells. Telomere length (TL) was measured by QRT-PCR as abundance of telomere template versus a single gene copy encoding acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0. Only white blood count (WBC) was significantly different in TL tertile subgroups in all subjects (P = 0.02) and in men (P = 0.01), but not in women. Merely in men significant but weak positive correlations were found between TL and WBC (r = 0.11, P < 0.05) and RBC (r = 0.08, P < 0.05). The multiple regression analysis models confirmed a weak, independent contribution of TL to both RBC and WBC.","In the elderly, telomere shortening limits hematopoiesis capacity to a very limited extent.",closed_qa
Does phentolamine mesylate relax penile corpus cavernosum tissue by adrenergic and non-adrenergic mechanisms?,"We investigated the biochemical and physiological mechanisms of action of phentolamine mesylate (Vasomax) in regulating erectile tissue smooth muscle contractility in human and rabbit corpus cavernosum. The binding activity of phentolamine was investigated in a cell-free system by displacement of specific and selective radiolabelled ligands to alpha 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors. The physiologic activity of phentolamine-mediated relaxation of adrenergic and non-adrenergic pre-contracted erectile tissue strips of human and rabbit corpus cavernosum were studied in organ bath chambers. In corpus cavernosum membranes, phentolamine displaced binding of the selective alpha 1 receptor antagonists [125I]HEAT and [3H]prazosin and the alpha 2 receptor antagonists [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]RX 821002 with relatively high affinity. Phentolamine caused concentration dependent relaxation in erectile tissue strips pre-contracted with adrenergic agonists phenylephrine, norepinephrine, oxymetazoline and UK 14,304, as well as with non-adrenergic contractile agents endothelin and KCl. Biochemical and physiologic studies reveal that the concentration of phentolamine required to displace half maximal binding or to produce half-maximal relaxation was similar to that found in human plasma 30 min after ingestion of 40 mg of Vasomax. Reversible inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by L-nitroarginine or mechanical disruption of endothelium diminished non-adrenergic phentolamine-mediated erectile tissue relaxation.","Phentolamine mesylate induced relaxation of corpus cavernosum erectile tissue by direct antagonism of alpha 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors and by indirect functional antagonism via a non-adrenergic, endothelium-mediated mechanism suggesting nitric oxide synthase activation.",closed_qa
Can improved quality of care explain the success of orthogeriatric units?,"admission to orthogeriatric units improves clinical outcomes for patients with hip fracture; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. to compare quality of in-hospital care, 30-day mortality, time to surgery (TTS) and length of hospital stay (LOS) among patients with hip fracture admitted to orthogeriatric and ordinary orthopaedic units, respectively. population-based cohort study. using prospectively collected data from the Danish Multidisciplinary Hip Fracture Registry, we identified 11,461 patients aged ≥65 years admitted with a hip fracture between 1 March 2010 and 30 November 2011. The patients were divided into two groups: (i) those treated at an orthogeriatric unit, where the geriatrician is an integrated part of the multidisciplinary team, and (ii) those treated at an ordinary orthopaedic unit, where geriatric or medical consultant service are available on request. Outcome measures were the quality of care as reflected by six process performance measures, 30-day mortality, the TTS and the LOS. Data were analysed using log-binomial, linear and logistic regression controlling for potential confounders. admittance to orthogeriatric units was associated with a higher chance for fulfilling five out of six process performance measures. Patients who were admitted to an orthogeriatric unit experienced a lower 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.69; 95% CI 0.54-0.88), whereas the LOS (adjusted relative time (aRT) of 1.18; 95% CI 0.92-1.52) and the TTS (aRT 1.06; 95% CI 0.89-1.26) were similar.",admittance to an orthogeriatric unit was associated with improved quality of care and lower 30-day mortality among patients with hip fracture.,closed_qa
Routine ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology for evaluation of palpable thyroid nodules in an endemic area: is it justified?,"To prospectively evaluate the efficacy of routine ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of thyroid nodules in an endemic area and to analyze the factors influencing it. Patients with thyroid nodules were randomly subjected to either conventional palpation-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (PFNAC) or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (USFNAC). The results of cytology were compared with the final histopathologic diagnosis in 112 patients who had undergone surgery. The performance of both methods was individually analyzed in solid nodules, cystic nodules, and solitary and multinodular goitres. Overall, USFNAC showed a significantly higher sensitivity (83.3% vs 54.6%, p<.001), positive predictive value (100% vs 85.7%, p<.001), and greater diagnostic accuracy (96.5% vs 89.1%, p = .052) compared with PFNAC. The sensitivity of USFNAC was significantly higher compared with that of PFNAC in cystic and complex nodules (75% vs 50%, p<.001) but not in solid nodules (77.8% vs 75%, p>.05). USFNAC was more sensitive and more accurate than PFNAC for detection of malignancy in multinodular goitres (66.7% vs 50%, p<.05; 95.6% vs 86.2%, p<.05, respectively).","The superiority of ""routine"" USFNAC over PFNAC is mainly due to its better performance in cystic nodules and multinodular goitres.

Is magnetic resonance imaging measurement of the contralateral normal meniscus a more accurate method of determining meniscal allograft size than radiographic measurement of the recipient tibial plateau?,"The purpose of this study was to develop and validate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning of the contralateral meniscus as a more accurate method of determining the needed size of a meniscal allograft than the traditional method of inferring meniscal size from radiographic measurement of the ipsilateral tibial plateau. Tissue bank meniscal size records from the left and right knees of 500 meniscal donors were analyzed for symmetry. The menisci of 10 cadaveric knees were then sized indirectly via the radiographic tibial plateau method and directly via MRI and actual physical measurement. The MRI and radiographic methods were then compared. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine error rates for each imaging method by comparison to the physical meniscal measurements. Of the 500 pairs of menisci, 97% were found to be within 3 mm of each other in both the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral dimensions. In the cadaveric study MRI measurement predicted actual meniscal size significantly better than the radiographic tibial plateau method.","Human knee menisci are bilaterally symmetric in size. Direct MRI measurement of the contralateral intact meniscus better predicts actual meniscal size than estimation of size indirectly from measurement of the tibial plateau on which it is located. We, therefore, propose contralateral MRI meniscal measurement as a new gold standard to size menisci before transplantation.",closed_qa
Do excitation patterns of simultaneous and sequential dual-electrode stimulation in cochlear implant recipients?,"Both simultaneous (SI) and sequential stimulation of intracochlear electrodes can be used to generate pitches that are intermediate to the physical electrodes (PEs). The goal of this study was to compare the spread of neural excitation for SI and sequential dual-electrode stimulation with the spread of neural excitation for the intermediate electrode using electrically evoked compound action potentials. Seven Advanced Bionics cochlear implant users with either CII or HiRes 90k implant and HiFocus 1 or HiFocus 1j electrode array participated in this study. A masker-probe subtraction method was used to derive neural excitation patterns for SI nonadjacent dual-electrode stimulation, apical and basal-first sequential nonadjacent dual-electrode stimulation, and the intermediate PE. For apical-first sequential (SEa) stimulation, the masker pulse on the apical electrode immediately preceded the masker pulse on the basal electrode, and vice versa for basal-first sequential stimulation (SEb). The electrodes used for dual-electrode stimulation were separated by an intermediate PE, which represents a spatial distance of approximately 2 mm. Current levels necessary to achieve comfortable loudness were determined for each masker and probe stimulus. During the evoked compound action potential measurements, the masker was fixed in location, whereas the probe was varied across a subset of electrodes in the array. Neural responses were calculated by subtracting the response to the probe from the masked response. Neural excitation patterns were normalized to their peak and analyzed in terms of their area and center of gravity. The area and center of gravity for SI nonadjacent dual-electrode stimulation were similar to those of the intermediate PE. In contrast, the area for the two modes of sequential nonadjacent dual-electrode (SEa and SEb) stimulation differed significantly from the intermediate PE. The center of gravity for SEa stimulation also differed significantly from the intermediate PE, whereas there was no significant difference in the center of gravity between SEb stimulation and the intermediate PE.","Peripheral neural activation patterns suggest a similar spread of excitation for SI dual-electrode stimulation and the intermediate PE. The spread of excitation associated with sequential dual-electrode stimulation is generally different from the intermediate PE, and it varies depending on the order of the sequential pulses.",closed_qa

"Are beta defensin-1 gene ( DEFB1 ) polymorphisms associated with atopic dermatitis in children and adolescents from northeast Brazil ( Recife , Pernambuco )?","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease resulting from the interplay between environmental, immunological and genetic factors. In our study, we investigated the role of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 5'-UTR of DEFB1 gene, encoding for the human beta defensin-1, on the susceptibility to develop AD in a group of Brazilian children and adolescents. Three SNPs, -20 G/A (rs11362), -44 C/G (rs1800972), and -52 G/A (rs1799946) at 5'-UTR of DEFB1 gene were genotyped in two groups of children and adolescents, one affected by AD (96 subjects), the other healthy (191 individuals), from northeast Brazil. -44 C/G frequencies were comparable between the two groups. The -20 GG genotype was more frequent in AD subjects than in healthy controls; the -52 GG, conversely, was more frequent in healthy controls than in AD. However, both these differences did not reach statistical significance. Also, association between SNPs and AD severity has been shown. The analysis of DEFB1 haplotypes did not highlight any association of the three SNPs with AD development or disease severity.","Our results seem to exclude a role for the -44 C/G DEFB1 SNPs on the pathogenesis and severity of AD, while for the -20 C/G and -52 G/A, even if not statistically significant, we evidenced a slight trend for susceptibility (-20 GG) and protection (-52 GG) for the development of AD.

Is delirium an important predictor of incident dementia among elderly hip fracture patients?,"Delirium is believed to constitute a risk factor for dementia, but previous research has failed to satisfactorily take account of the patients' preexisting level of cognitive functioning. A prospective 6-month follow-up of 106 elderly hip fracture patients free from prefracture dementia. Delirium was assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method. Caregivers described the patients' prefracture cognition by the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Short Form (IQCODE-SF). Cognition was measured after 6 months, using 5 validated cognitive tests. An expert panel assessed each case as to whether the diagnostic criteria for dementia according to the DSM-IV were fulfilled at baseline and after 6 months. 29/106 patients (27%) developed delirium in the acute phase. In the delirious group, 11/29 (38%) fulfilled the criteria of dementia after 6 months, compared to 5/77 (7%) in the group without delirium (p < 0.001; χ(2) test).

Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia and mortality in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy: can noninducibility after ablation be a predictor for reduced mortality?,"Data on outcomes after catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) are insufficient. We aimed to investigate the effects of successful catheter ablation of VT on cardiac mortality in patients with NIDCM. One hundred two patients with NIDCM (86 men; mean age, 58.8±15.2 years; mean ejection fraction, 33.3±11.9%) underwent VT ablation. After catheter ablation, a programmed ventricular stimulation to test for success was performed. Complete VT noninducibility was achieved in 62 (61%) patients and partial success or failure in 32 (31%) patients. During 2 years of follow-up, VT recurrence was observed in 33 patients (53%) without inducible VTs and in 24 patients (75%) with inducible VT inducible (P=0.041). VT inducibility was associated with higher VT recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.13; P=0.025). The primary end point of all-cause mortality was reached in 9 patients (15%) with noninducible VTs versus 11 patients (34%) with inducible sustained VTs (P=0.026). VT inducibility was associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.003-7.43; P=0.049).","In patients with NIDCM and recurrent sustained VTs, a complete ablation of all inducible VTs may be achieved in 60% of the cases.

Importantly, if possible to achieve through ablation, a complete VT noninducibility was associated with reduction of the likelihood for all-cause mortality in patients with NIDCM.",closed_qa
Is general surgical operative duration associated with increased risk-adjusted infectious complication rates and length of hospital stay?,"Studies of specific procedures have shown increases in infectious complications with operative duration. We hypothesized that operative duration is independently associated with increased risk-adjusted infectious complication (IC) rates in a broad range of general surgical procedures. We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for general surgical operations performed from 2005 to 2007. ICs (wound infection, sepsis, urinary tract infection, and/or pneumonia) and length of hospital stay (LOS) were evaluated versus operative duration (OD, ie, incision to closure). Multivariable regression adjusted for 38 patient risk variables, operation type and complexity, wound class and intraoperative transfusion. We also analyzed isolated laparoscopic cholecystectomies in patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 or 2, without intraoperative transfusion and with a clean or clean-contaminated wound class. In 299,359 operations performed at 173 hospitals, unadjusted IC rates increased linearly with OD at a rate of close to 2.5% per half hour (chi-square test for linear trend, p < 0.001). After adjustment, IC risk increased for each half hour of OD relative to cases lasting <or=1 hour, almost doubling at 2.1 to 2.5 hours (odds ratio = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.82 to 2.03; p < 0.001). In isolated laparoscopic cholecystectomy, IC rates increased linearly with OD (n = 17,018, chi-square test for linear trend, p < 0.001) with rates for 1.1 to 1.5 hour cases (1.4%) doubling those lasting <or=0.5 hour (0.7%). Across all procedures, adjusted LOS increased geometrically with operative duration at a rate of about 6% per half hour (coefficient for natural log transformed LOS = 0.059 per half hour; 95% CI, 0.058 to 0.060; p < 0.001).",Operative duration is independently associated with increased ICs and LOS after adjustment for procedure and patient risk factors.,closed_qa
Does Effectiveness of Adolescent Smoking-Cessation Intervention Endure Into Young Adulthood?,"The Hutchinson Study of High School Smoking was the first randomized trial to show effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention on 6-months prolonged smoking abstinence at one year post-intervention in a large population-based sample of adolescent smokers. An important question remains: Do the positive effects from teen smoking cessation interventions seen at up to 12 months post-intervention endure into young adulthood? This study examines for the first time whether such positive early effects from teen smoking cessation intervention can endure into young adulthood in the absence of additional intervention. High school smokers (n = 2,151) were proactively recruited into the trial from fifty randomly selected Washington State high schools randomized to the experimental (Motivational Interviewing + Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training telephone counseling intervention) or control (no intervention) condition. These smokers were followed to 7 years post high school to ascertain rates of six-year prolonged smoking abstinence in young adulthood. All statistical tests are two-sided. No evidence of intervention impact at seven years post high school was observed for the main endpoint of six-year prolonged abstinence, neither among all smokers (14.2% in the experimental condition vs. 13.1% in the control condition, difference = +1.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.4 to 5.8, p = .61), nor among the subgroups of daily smokers and less-than-daily smokers, nor among other a priori subgroups. But, observed among males was some evidence of an intervention impact on two endpoints related to progress towards quitting: reduction in number of days smoked in the past month, and increase in the length of the longest quit attempt in the past year.","There was no evidence from this trial among adolescent smokers that positive effectiveness of the proactive telephone intervention for smoking abstinence, observed previously at one year post-intervention, was sustained for the long-term into young adulthood. In light of the positive short-term effectiveness consistently observed from this and other trials for teen smokers, together with the lack of evidence from this study that such short-term impact can endure into young adulthood, sustained interventions that continue into young adulthood should be developed and tested for long-term impact.",closed_qa
Are dacryocytes a common morphologic feature of autoimmune and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia?,"Dacryocytes are teardrop-shaped erythrocytes which are most frequently observed in peripheral blood smears of patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis as well as malignant infiltrative disorders of the bone marrow.

The clear prevalence of dacryocytes in AIHA and MAHA is unknown. We compared the dacryocyte counts in blood smears stained according to the May-Grünwald-Giemsa technique between 20 subjects with AIHA and MAHA with those from 21 controls. The dacryocytes, defined as erythrocytes tapered to a point at one end, were counted as cells per 20 high power fields (HPF) at 630-fold magnification. In AIHA, MAHA and controls, dacryocytes were found in 89%, 91% and 19% of the slides, respectively. The rate of dacryocyte positivity and the dacryocyte counts between haemolytic anaemias and controls differed statistically highly significant (p<0.0001).",The results of this study indicate that dacryocytes are commonly apparent in blood smears of patients with AIHA and MAHA. Knowledge of this frequent feature may be beneficial in clinical routine diagnosis.,closed_qa
Is transplantation of a few leukemic cells inside an artificial ovary able to induce leukemia in an experimental model?,"To evaluate the tumor-inducing ability of a few leukemic cells xenotransplanted inside an artificial ovary. Ten and 100 BV-173 leukemic cells were embedded in a fibrin matrix along with 50,000 human ovarian stromal cells, and grafted to the peritoneal bursa of 5 and 5 SCID mice respectively. Four mice grafted with 3x10(6) leukemic cells in fibrin served as positive controls. At 20 weeks post-transplantation, the grafts, liver, spleen, blood and bone marrow were analyzed for the presence of leukemia by anti-CD79α IHC, flow cytometry (FC) and PCR. All mice grafted with 3x10(6) cells developed peritoneal masses 4 weeks after xenotransplantation, and systemic disease was confirmed by IHC, PCR and FC. Among mice grafted with 10 or 100 leukemic cells, none showed any sign of leukemia after 20 weeks, and IHC, FC and PCR on the different recovered tissues all proved negative.","This study investigates the tumor-inducing potential of a few leukemic cells grafted inside an artificial ovary. Transplantation of 100 leukemic cells appears to be insufficient to induce leukemia after 20 weeks. These results in an immunodeficient xenografting model are quite reassuring. However, for clinical application, follicle suspensions must be purged of leukemic cells before grafting, as even the slightest risk should be avoided.",closed_qa
Is the white blood cell count an independent predictor of no-reflow and mortality following acute myocardial infarction in the coronary interventional era?,"In the era before the use of coronary reperfusion therapy, an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count was associated with a higher risk of adverse events following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the relationship between WBC count and prognosis after AMI has not been investigated since coronary intervention was introduced. To evaluate whether a high WBC count within 48 hours of the onset of AMI predicts future adverse events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We evaluated 1,016 patients who underwent PCI in the acute phase of MI using the Japanese Acute Coronary Syndrome Study (JACSS) database. RESULTS. WBC count was significantly associated with smoking, sudden onset AMI, and the no-reflow phenomenon during PCI, as were age, peak creatine kinase level, and Killip class. An elevated WBC count was significantly associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Patients in the highest quartile of WBC count were about three times more likely to have a poor prognosis after AMI compared to those in the lowest quartile.",The WBC count is of great significance for stratifying patient risk and can be used as a universal marker for predicting future adverse events following any treatment for AMI.,closed_qa
Relation between the incidence of invasive cervical cancer and the screening interval: is a five year interval too long?,"To examine the incidence of invasive cervical cancer per 100,000 women years at risk and relative risk according to screening history among eligible women aged 25-69 in Southampton and South West Hampshire during the three years after completion of the first round of comprehensive screening. There was a significantly higher incidence of invasive cervical cancer in women who had not been screened during the preceding 0.5-5.5 years than in those who had been screened (relative risk (RR) 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 4.3). Among the latter group of women (with interval cancers) there was a significantly higher incidence in those with a long interval of 3.5-5.5 years since their most recent smear than in those with a short interval of 0.5-3.5 years (RR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8). Among women with non-interval cancers, there was a significantly higher incidence among those who had no cytology record than among those who had been screened but were overdue for a smear (RR 3.0; 95% CI 1.2 to 7.3). When screen detected cancers were excluded from the figures the relative risks for all the comparative groups described above were greater, though the 95% confidence limits were wider because the numbers were smaller. The most pronounced difference in incidence was between symptomatic cancers in women with a short screening interval (5.8 per 100,000 women years at risk) and in women with no cytology record (71.3 per 100,000 years at risk). Most cancers were interval cancers (76%) because of the high screening coverage: 89.2% of eligible women aged 25-69 had been screened during the preceding 0.5-5.5 years. The overall incidence per 100000 women years at risk approached that of interval cancers, and was nearer to that observed in the short than the long interval because 74.7% of women had been screened within 3.5 years.","The results confirm the effectiveness of screening but suggest that a five year screening interval may be too long, at least during the early rounds of screening.",closed_qa
Are bystander signal production and response independent processes which are cell line dependent?,"Radiation-induced bystander effects are now an established phenomenon seen in numerous models; however it is not known whether the magnitude of the bystander effect is determined by the signal produced by the irradiated cells or the response of the exposed cells. The aim of this investigation is to determine the importance of the bystander signal versus the bystander response in three different cell line models. A matrix design experiment using cell lines, HPV-G, CHO-K1 and E89 (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6DP) null) was set up to produce irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM), which was used to treat all cell lines. For HPV-G and CHO-K1 lines, the response to autologous ICCM was significantly different to that when treated with ICCM generated from another line. These lines displayed no response to E89 ICCM, nor did E89 cells show a significant response to any ICCM, suggesting that G6DP plays a key role in the bystander effect.","These data suggest, for these cell lines at least, that in the case of cell lines capable of responding to the bystander signal, it is the signal produced by the irradiated cell that determines the magnitude of the bystander effect.",closed_qa
Is mouse gestation length genetically determined?,"Preterm birth is an enormous public health problem, affecting over 12% of live births and costing over $26 billion in the United States alone. The causes are complex, but twin studies support the role of genetics in determining gestation length. Despite widespread use of the mouse in studies of the genetics of preterm birth, there have been few studies that actually address the precise natural gestation length of the mouse, and to what degree the timing of labor and birth is genetically determined. To further develop the mouse as a genetic model of preterm birth, we developed a high-throughput monitoring system and measured the gestation length in 15 inbred strains. Our results show an unexpectedly wide variation in overall gestation length between strains that approaches two full days, while intra-strain variation is quite low. Although litter size shows a strong inverse correlation with gestation length, genetic difference alone accounts for a significant portion of the variation. In addition, ovarian transplant experiments support a primary role of maternal genetics in the determination of gestation length. Preliminary analysis of gestation length in the C57BL/6J-Chr#(A/J)/NaJ chromosome substitution strain (B.A CSS) panel suggests complex genetic control of gestation length.","Together, these data support the role of genetics in regulating gestation length and present the mouse as an important tool for the discovery of genes governing preterm birth.",closed_qa
Do geographic and educational factors influence the quality of life in rectal cancer patients with a permanent colostomy?,"This study was designed to evaluate possible social and geographic factors that could have an impact on quality of life in patients after abdominoperineal excision of the rectum. Although the number of patients with rectal cancer who need to be treated with abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and construction of permanent colostomy has greatly decreased in the past, there is still controversy about the influence on quality of life caused by this procedure. In a prospective trial, patients operated on for low rectal cancer by abdominoperineal excision of the rectum were evaluated by a quality of life questionnaire, modified from The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons questionnaire, to assess fecal incontinence. The results for the four domains of quality of life (lifestyle, coping behavior, embarrassment, depression), as well as for subjective general health, were evaluated with regard to age, gender, education, and geographic origin in univariate and multivariate analyses. Thirteen institutions in 11 countries included data from 257 patients. Although the analysis of general health did not reveal any significant differences, the analysis of the four quality of life domains showed the significant influence of geographic origin. The presence of a permanent colostomy showed a consistently negative impact on patients in southern Europe as well as for patients of Arabic (Islamic) origin. On the other hand, age, gender, and educational status did not reveal a statistically significant influence.","This is the first study to show the influence of geographic origin on quality of life of patients with a permanent colostomy. Possible factors that may influence the outcome of patients after surgical treatment of rectal cancer, such as weather, religion, or culture, should be taken into account when quality of life evaluations are considered.",closed_qa
Does fibrin glue treatment of complex anal fistulas have low success rate?,"Fibrin glue has been used to treat anal fistulas in an attempt to avoid more radical surgical intervention. Reported success rates vary widely. The purpose of this study was to review the use of fibrin glue in the management of complex anal fistulas at a tertiary referral center. This study was designed as a retrospective review of all patients treated with fibrin glue injection for complex anal fistulas in the Section of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Demographics, previous treatment, operative information, and early follow-up were obtained from the patients' medical records. Phone interviews were conducted to determine successful healing or recurrence of fistulas requiring further treatment. Statistical analysis was by Fisher's exact test. The institutional review board approved the study. A total of 42 patients (19 males; median age, 44 (range, 20-76) years) were treated between 1999 and 2002. Three patients were lost to follow-up and were excluded from the study. Etiology of fistulas were cryptoglandular (n = 22), Crohn's disease (n = 13), or coloanal and ileal pouch-anal anastomotic (n = 4). Fistulas were classified as deep transsphincteric (n = 33), superficial transsphincteric (n = 1), supralevator (n = 2), or rectovaginal (n = 3). Initially, most patients had ""closure"" of the fistula but recrudescence was common. Durable healing was only achieved in 31 percent (12/39). Healing rates by etiology were cryptoglandular 23 percent (5/22), Crohn's disease 31 percent (4/13), and ileal pouch-anal anastomotic 75 percent (3/4; P = 0.14). Success rates by classification were deep transsphincteric 33 percent (11/33), superficial transsphincteric 0 percent (0/1), supralevator 0 percent (0/2), and rectovaginal 33 percent (1/3; P = 1). The success rate for patients with no previous treatment was 38 percent (8/21) vs. 22 percent (4/18) in those whose fistulas had been previously treated ( P = 0.32). Eight patients underwent a second fibrin glue treatment and only one of them healed (12.5 percent). Median follow-up for successfully healed fistula was 26 months.","Fibrin glue treatment for complex anal fistulas has a low success rate and most recrudescences occurred within three months. However, given the low morbidity and relative simplicity of the procedure, fibrin glue should still be considered as a first-line treatment for patients with complex anal fistulas.",closed_qa
Does intestinal fatty acid binding protein in serum and urine reflect early ischemic injury to the small bowel?,"Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a 15 kd protein that constitutes 2% to 3% of enterocyte protein. Normally I-FABP is undetectable in serum. The purpose of this study was to determine whether I-FABP could be detected in peripheral serum and/or urine early in the evolution of intestinal ischemic injury. I-FABP and two putative biochemical markers of mesenteric ischemia, hexosaminidase and lactate dehydrogenase, were quantitated in the serum of rats subjected to mesenteric ischemia produced by: (1) 0.5 hours, 1 hour, or 3 hours of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion followed by reperfusion; (2) 1 hour of mesenteric occlusion to a 10 cm segment of jejunum followed by reperfusion; and (3) arterial ligation to a 10 cm segment of jejunum without reperfusion. I-FABP was also quantitated in the urine and intestinal mucosa of these animals. The baseline serum I-FABP level was < or = 4.0 ng/ml in all animals. In control animals, I-FABP remained unchanged throughout the experiment. In the ischemia/reperfusion groups, I-FABP immediately appeared in the serum on reperfusion. With segmental arterial ligation, I-FABP was detected in the serum within 15 minutes. Urinary content of I-FABP rose 60 minutes after its initial appearance in the serum, and its elimination paralleled serum I-FABP levels. Serum hexosaminidase and lactate dehydrogenase levels only rose after 3 hours of SMA occlusion with reperfusion. One hour of SMA occlusion and reperfusion resulted in only mild to moderate mucosal injury, whereas 3 hours of SMA ischemia with reperfusion produced areas of transmural necrosis.",I-FABP is released into the peripheral circulation after reversible intestinal ischemic injury and has potential as a biochemical marker to facilitate the early detection of mesenteric ischemia.,closed_qa
Does low-dose radiation potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of folate receptor-targeted hapten therapy?,"Human cancers frequently overexpress a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for the vitamin folic acid. Highly immunogenic haptens can be targeted to folate receptor-expressing cell surfaces by administration of folate-hapten conjugates, rendering the decorated tumor cell surfaces more recognizable by the immune system. Treatment of antihapten-immunized mice with folate-hapten constructs results in elimination of moderately sized tumors by the immune system. However, when subcutaneous tumors exceed 300 mm(3) before initiation of therapy, antitumor activity is significantly decreased. In an effort to enhance the efficacy of folate-targeted hapten immunotherapy (FTHI) against large tumors, we explored the combination of targeted hapten immunotherapy with low-dose radiotherapy. Mice bearing 300-mm(3) subcutaneous tumors were treated concurrently with FTHI (500 nmol/kg of folate conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, 20,000 U/dose of interleukin 2, and 25,000 U/dose of interferon alpha) and low-dose radiotherapy (3 Gy/dose focused directly on the desired tumor mass). The efficacy of therapy was evaluated by measuring tumor volume. Tumor growth analyses show that radiotherapy synergizes with FTHI in antihapten-immunized mice, thereby allowing for cures of animals bearing tumors greater than 300 mm(3). More importantly, nonirradiated distal tumor masses in animals containing locally irradiated tumors also showed improved response to hapten immunotherapy, suggesting that not all tumor lesions must be identified and irradiated to benefit from the combination therapy.",These results suggest that simultaneous treatment with FTHI and radiation therapy can enhance systemic antitumor activity in tumor-bearing mice.,closed_qa
Is high-dose radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid carcinoma associated with change in female fertility or any genetic risk to the offspring?,"We tried to evaluate the female fertility and genetic risk to the offspring from the exposure to high-dose (131)I by assessing the pregnancy outcomes and health status of the children of female patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had received therapeutic doses of (131)I. From 1967 to 2002, a total of 1,282 women had been treated with (131)I. Of these patients, 692 (54%) were in the reproductive age group (18-45 years). Forty women had a total of 50 pregnancies after high-dose (131)I. Age at presentation ranged from 16 to 36 years (mean, 23 +/- 4 years). Histopathology was papillary thyroid cancer in 32 cases and follicular thyroid cancer in 8 cases. Single high-dose therapy was given in 30 cases, 2 doses were given in 7 cases, 3 doses were given in 2 cases, and four doses were given in 1 case in which lung metastases had occurred. In 37 patients (92%), disease was successfully ablated before pregnancy. Ovarian absorbed-radiation dose calculated by the MIRD method ranged from 3.5 to 60 cGy (mean, 12 +/- 11 cGy). The interval between (131)I therapy and pregnancy varied from 7 to 120 months (37.4 +/- 28.2 months). Three spontaneous abortions occurred in 2 women. Forty-seven babies (20 females and 27 males) were born. Forty-four babies were healthy with normal birth weight and normal developmental milestones. Twenty women delivered their first baby after (131)I therapy. The youngest child in our series is 11 months of age, and the oldest is 8.5 years of age.","Female fertility is not affected by high-dose radioiodine treatment, and the therapy does not appear to be associated with any genetic risks to the offspring.",closed_qa
Does staphylococcus epidermidis pan-genome sequence analysis reveal diversity of skin commensal and hospital infection-associated isolates?,"While Staphylococcus epidermidis is commonly isolated from healthy human skin, it is also the most frequent cause of nosocomial infections on indwelling medical devices. Despite its importance, few genome sequences existed and the most frequent hospital-associated lineage, ST2, had not been fully sequenced. We cultivated 71 commensal S. epidermidis isolates from 15 skin sites and compared them with 28 nosocomial isolates from venous catheters and blood cultures. We produced 21 commensal and 9 nosocomial draft genomes, and annotated and compared their gene content, phylogenetic relatedness and biochemical functions. The commensal strains had an open pan-genome with 80% core genes and 20% variable genes. The variable genome was characterized by an overabundance of transposable elements, transcription factors and transporters. Biochemical diversity, as assayed by antibiotic resistance and in vitro biofilm formation, demonstrated the varied phenotypic consequences of this genomic diversity. The nosocomial isolates exhibited both large-scale rearrangements and single-nucleotide variation. We showed that S. epidermidis genomes separate into two phylogenetic groups, one consisting only of commensals. The formate dehydrogenase gene, present only in commensals, is a discriminatory marker between the two groups.","Commensal skin S. epidermidis have an open pan-genome and show considerable diversity between isolates, even when derived from a single individual or body site. For ST2, the most common nosocomial lineage, we detect variation between three independent isolates sequenced. Finally, phylogenetic analyses revealed a previously unrecognized group of S. epidermidis strains characterized by reduced virulence and formate dehydrogenase, which we propose as a clinical molecular marker.",closed_qa
Is habitual physical activity associated with endothelial function and endothelial progenitor cells in patients with stable coronary artery disease?,"Exercise training reduces mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD); however, the impact of habitual physical activity level (PAL) on vascular endothelial function and circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) remain unknown. We assessed habitual PAL using a validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire in 116 patients (67.8+/-9.5 years; 81% male) with stable CAD and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction > or =45%. The number of circulating CD34/KDR+ and CD133/KDR+ EPCs was determined by flow cytometry, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured. The mean PAL of CAD patients with 1644 MET min/week (where MET is metabolic equivalents). With higher habitual PAL tertiles, there were significant linear trends of increased FMD (P = 0.001) and CD133/KDR+ EPCs (P = 0.03), but not of CD34/KDR+ EPCs. Patients with the highest tertile of PAL were associated with an absolute increase of 1.89% in FMD (relative increase 68%, P = 0.003) and 0.12% in CD133/KDR+ EPCs (relative increase 44%, P = 0.01) compared with those in the lowest tertile of PAL, after adjusting for age, sex, presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and the use of medications including statins. However, neither CD34/KDR+ nor CD133/KDR+ EPCs significantly correlated with FMD.","This study showed that higher habitual PAL in patients with CAD was associated with higher FMD and EPC count. Nonetheless, FMD only significantly correlated with increased PAL, but not EPC, suggesting that increased physical activity improves endothelial function through mechanisms other than increasing EPC count.",closed_qa
Does vital capacity induction with 8 % sevoflurane and N2o cause cerebral hyperemia?,"Little is known about the influence of high-dose sevoflurane on cerebral volume. We evaluated induction time and cerebral blood volume with 8% sevoflurane using the ""vital capacity induction"" technique. Thirty-four patients were randomly allocated into three groups. Group P received 2.0 mg x kg(-1) of propofol i.v. and inhalation of 67% N2o/O2, whereas group S5 and group S8 received inhalation of primed 5% and 8% sevoflurane in 67% N2O/O2, respectively. Induction time was measured as the time from the start of inhalation, or from the end of injection, until loss of eyelash reflex. Near-infrared spectroscopy and bispectral index (BIS) were monitored continuously until 3 min after tracheal intubation. Induction time was less in group S8 (17.3 +/- 6.4s, mean +/- SD) than in groups P (25.7 +/- 8.2s) and S5 (33.0 +/- 16.8s). There was a significant increase in cerebral blood volume after intubation in group S8, as suggested by higher cerebral oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin levels. There were no differences in BIS scores among the groups during the study period.","Vital capacity inhalation of 8% sevoflurane produces a faster loss of eyelash reflex than does 5% sevoflurane or propofol, but increases cerebral blood volume.",closed_qa
Is thrombomodulin a new biological and prognostic marker for breast cancer : an immunohistochemical study?,"Thrombomodulin (TM) is a natural anticoagulant which inhibits thrombin. Recent studies have reported that TM is correlated with vascular diseases and a few cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role and the prognostic value of TM in breast cancer. TM expression in samples from 60 invasive breast cancer patients was examined immunohistochemically with a polyclonal antibody against TM. TM staining was observed mainly on both the cytoplasm and cell surface in cancer cells and on endothelial cells around or in cancer tissue. TM expression in cancer cells was not correlated with the clinicopathological features. However, low TM expression was significantly correlated with a high relapse rate (p = 0.047 by the chi 2 test and 0.05 by the Kaplan-Meier method).","TM might play an active role in cancer invasion and metastasis, and serve as a new prognostic factor in invasive breast cancer.",closed_qa
Does periostin directly and indirectly promote tumor lymphangiogenesis of head and neck cancer?,"Metastasis to regional lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels plays a key role in cancer progression. Tumor lymphangiogenesis is known to promote lymphatic metastasis, and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) is a critical activator of tumor lymphangiogenesis during the process of metastasis. We previously identified periostin as an invasion- and angiogenesis-promoting factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study, we discovered a novel role for periostin in tumor lymphangiogenesis. Periostin overexpression upregulated VEGF-C mRNA expression in HNSCC cells. By using conditioned media from periostin-overexpressing HNSCC cells, we examined tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells. Conditioned media from periostin-overexpressing cells promoted tube formation. To know the correlation between periostin and VEGF-C, we compared Periostin expression with VEGF-C expression in 54 HNSCC cases by immunohistochemistry. Periostin expression was correlated well with VEGF-C expression in HNSCC cases. Moreover, correlation between periostin and VEGF-C secretion was observed in serum from HNSCC patients. Interestingly, periostin itself promoted tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells independently of VEGF-C. Periostin-promoted lymphangiogenesis was mediated by Src and Akt activity. Indeed possible correlation between periostin and lymphatic status in periostin-overexpressing xenograft tumors and HNSCC cases was observed.",Our findings suggest that periostin itself as well as periostin-induced upregulation of VEGF-C may promote lymphangiogenesis. We suggest that periostin may be a marker for prediction of malignant behaviors in HNSCC and a potential target for future therapeutic intervention to obstruct tumoral lymphatic invasion and lymphangiogenesis in HNSCC patients.,closed_qa
Does hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale predict physical fitness testing performance?,"An eight-item activity scale was recently developed and validated for use as a prognostic tool in clinical research in children and adolescents. It is unclear, however, if this brief questionnaire is predictive of quantitative metrics of physical activity and fitness. The purposes of this study were to prospectively administer the Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale to a large cohort of healthy adolescents to determine (1) if the activity scale exhibits any floor or ceiling effects; (2) if scores on the activity scale are correlated with standardized physical fitness metrics; and if so, (3) to determine the discrimination ability of the activity scale to differentiate between adolescents with healthy or unhealthy levels of aerobic capacity and calculate an appropriate cutoff value for its use as a screening tool. One hundred eighty-two adolescents (mean, 15.3 years old) prospectively completed the activity scale and four standardized metrics of physical fitness: pushups, sit-ups, shuttle run exercise (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run), and calculated VO2-max. Age, sex, and body mass index were also recorded. Pearson correlations, regression analyses, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to evaluate activity scale performance. The activity scale did not exhibit any floor or ceiling effects. Pushups (ρ = 0.28), sit-ups (ρ = 0.23), performance on the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (ρ = 0.44), and VO2-max (ρ = 0.43) were all positively correlated with the activity scale score (Pearson correlations, all p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that those with an activity score of ≤ 14 were at higher risk of having low levels of aerobic capacity.","In the current study, activity score was free of floor and ceiling effects and predictive of all four physical fitness metrics. An activity score of ≤ 14 was associated with at-risk aerobic capacity previously shown to be associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. This study is the first to prospectively validate an activity questionnaire against quantitative physical fitness assessments and provides further evidence substantiating its use in outcomes research and screening for healthy levels of childhood activity and fitness.",closed_qa
Does tGFbeta induce morphological and molecular changes similar to human anterior subcapsular cataract?,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) has been shown to induce subcapsular plaques in cultured rat lenses as well as in lenses of transgenic mice. In the present study the authors have extended their analysis of these cataract models to determine how closely they mimic human cataract. In particular, they studied the maturation of cataract in the transgenic model to determine if it develops similar features as previously described for anterior subcapsular cataract (ASC) in humans. Furthermore, they investigated whether both of these animal models express the range of molecular markers that have now been shown to be present in human ASC. Histology and periodic acid Schiff staining were used to study the development and maturation of subcapsular plaques in transgenic mice overexpressing TGFbeta1 in the lens. Immunolabelling methods were used to identify the molecular markers for ASC in both the transgenic mouse model and in rat lenses cultured with TGFbeta2. Histological analysis showed that the subcapsular plaques that develop in adult transgenic mouse lenses bear a striking similarity to mature human ASC, including the formation of a new epithelial-like layer extending between the subcapsular plaque and the underlying fibre mass. All known molecular markers for human ASC were induced in both rodent models, including collagen types I and III, tenascin, and fibronectin. They also identified the presence of desmin in these plaques, a putative novel marker for human cataract.",In both transgenic mouse and rat lens culture models TGFbeta induces markers similar to those found in human ASC. Atypical expression of these cataract markers is also characteristic of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). The molecular markers expressed are typical of a myofibroblastic/fibroblastic phenotype and suggest that a common feature of ASC and PCO may be induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition by TGFbeta.,closed_qa
Is tBP2 a substitute for TBP in Xenopus oocyte transcription?,"TATA-box-binding protein 2 (TBP2/TRF3) is a vertebrate-specific paralog of TBP that shares with TBP a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain and the ability to bind the TATA box. TBP2 is highly expressed in oocytes whereas TBP is more abundant in embryos. We find that TBP2 is proteolytically degraded upon meiotic maturation; after germinal vesicle breakdown relatively low levels of TBP2 expression persist. Furthermore, TBP2 localizes to the transcriptionally active loops of lampbrush chromosomes and is recruited to a number of injected promoters in oocyte nuclei. Using an altered binding specificity mutant reporter system we show that TBP2 promotes RNA polymerase II transcription in vivo. Intriguingly, TBP, which in oocytes is undetectable at the protein level, can functionally replace TBP2 when ectopically expressed in oocytes, showing that switching of initiation factors can be driven by changes in their expression. Proteolytic degradation of TBP2 is not required for repression of transcription during meiotic maturation, suggesting a redundant role in this repression or a role in initiation factor switching between oocytes and embryos.","The expression and transcriptional activity of TBP2 in oocytes show that TBP2 is the predominant initiation factor in oocytes, which is substituted by TBP on a subset of promoters in embryos as a result of proteolytic degradation of TBP2 during meiotic maturation.",closed_qa
Does outer Segment Thickness predict Visual Field Response to QLT091001 in Patients?,"To determine whether the degree of change in Goldmann visual fields (GVFs) following oral administration of QLT091001 was related to baseline measures of retinal structure. Oral QLT091001 was administered once daily for 7 days in all study patients. Comprehensive ophthalmic testing, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), was conducted in 14 patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and 18 patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) at seven international sites. Average thickness of the outer segment (OS) layer was calculated over central 20°. Both eyes of each subject were evaluated separately. Nineteen of 28 eyes (68%) with LCA and 13 of 36 eyes (36%) with RP responded to QLT091001. Among these responders, the average baseline thickness of the OS layer (central 20°) was 13.5 μm in the LCA cohort and 11.7 μm in the RP cohort. Nonresponders had average baseline OS thickness of less than 4.6 μm in both cohorts. The OS thickness in the central 20° was significantly shorter in nonresponders than responders in the LCA cohort (",The present findings suggest that there is a close parallel between the thickness of the photoreceptor layer and the potential for functional improvement in these patients.,closed_qa
Is the maternal homocysteine pathway influenced by riboflavin intake and MTHFR polymorphisms without affecting the risk of orofacial clefts in the offspring?,"Riboflavin is a cofactor for the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme involved in the homocysteine pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal riboflavin intake and two MTHFR polymorphisms (677C>T; Ala222Val and 1298A>C; Glu429Ala substitutions) on the biomarkers of the homocysteine pathway, and investigate the risk of having offspring with an orofacial cleft (OFC). In a case-control study design, dietary riboflavin intake and the MTHFR 677C>T and 1298A>C polymorphisms were evaluated in 123 OFC and 108 control mothers by using food frequency questionnaires and blood samples. Homocysteine (tHcy), folate and vitamin B12 concentrations in blood were analyzed in 70 cases and 68 controls. Linear and logistic regression analyses were applied. At 14 months postpartum riboflavin intake and MTHFR 677C>T and 1298A>C genotypes were not significantly different between cases and controls. The 677TT genotype showed lower folate concentrations compared to C-allele carriers with a mean difference of 2.8 nmol/l in serum and 174 nmol/l in red blood cell (both P's=0.01). Every mg per day increase of dietary riboflavin intake was positively associated with increase in vitamin B12 concentration by 52.1% (P<0.01). This effect was most pronounced in MTHFR 677TT homozygotes (205.1%, P=0.03). The riboflavin-adjusted MTHFR 677TT and 1298CC genotypes showed a trend toward an increasing risk for OFC, adjusted odds ratio 1.7 (confidence interval (95% CI), 0.7-4.5) and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.7-4.2), respectively.","Maternal riboflavin intake is significantly associated with biomarkers of the homocysteine pathway, with the strongest effects in MTHFR 677TT homozygotes. The maternal risk of having OFC offspring, however, is not associated with dietary riboflavin intake.",closed_qa
Does growth hormone treatment after cesarean delivery in rats increase the strength of the uterine scar?,"We sought to determine whether postcesarean treatment of rats with growth hormone (GH) affected the strength of the uterine incision in the puerperium and in a subsequent pregnancy. Forty-eight near-term pregnant rats were delivered by cesarean section. Half received subcutaneous recombinant human GH (2.0 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 7 days; control animals received saline injections. Four weeks after delivery, the uterine bursting pressure was determined in 5 treated and 5 control animals. Eight rats in each group were used to study uterine hydroxyproline concentrations and the histologic characteristics of the scar. Twenty-two animals were rebred 30 to 40 days after their cesarean sections. After repeat cesarean delivery, on day 19, the bursting pressure and hydroxyproline concentrations of the previous hysterotomy scar were determined. The uterine horn bursting pressure in the GH-treated animals was significantly greater than that in the control animals both 28 days postpartum and near term in a subsequent pregnancy. The uterine hydroxyproline concentrations followed the same pattern. Histologic study of the scars showed they were thicker and had less cellularity in the treated animals than in the control animals.",Postcesarean treatment with GH increased the bursting strength of rat uterine incisions. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in collagen content and persisted through a subsequent pregnancy.,closed_qa
Does vertebral Implantation of NELL-1 enhance Bone Formation in an Osteoporotic Sheep Model?,"Vertebral compression fractures related to osteoporosis greatly afflict the aging population. One of the most commonly used therapy today is balloon kyphoplasty. However, this treatment is far from ideal and is associated with significant side effects. NELL-1, an osteoinductive factor that possesses both pro-osteogenic and anti-osteoclastic properties, is a promising candidate for an alternative to current treatment modalities. This study utilizes the pro-osteogenic properties of recombinant human NELL-1 (rhNELL-1) in lumbar spine vertebral defect model in osteoporotic sheep. Osteoporosis was induced through ovariectomy, dietary depletion of calcium and vitamin D, and steroid administration. After osteoporotic induction, lumbar vertebral body defect creation was performed. Sheep were randomly implanted with the control vehicle, comprised of hyaluronic acid (HA) with hydroxyapatite-coated β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), or the treatment material of rhNELL-1 protein lyophilized onto β-TCP mixed with HA. Analysis of lumbar spine defect healing was performed by radiographic, histologic, and computer-simulated biomechanical testing. rhNELL-1 treatment significantly increased lumbar spine bone formation, as determined by bone mineral density, % bone volume, and mean cortical width as assessed by micro-computed tomography. Histological analysis revealed a significant increase in bone area and osteoblast number and decrease in osteoclast number around the implant site. Computer-simulated biomechanical analysis of trabecular bone demonstrated that rhNELL-1-treatment resulted in a significantly more stress-resistant composition.",Our findings suggest rhNELL-1-based vertebral implantation successfully improved cortical and cancellous bone regeneration in the lumbar spine of osteoporotic sheep. rhNELL-1-based bone graft substitutes represent a potential new local therapy.,closed_qa
Is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein associated with the presence of coronary artery calcium in subjects with normal blood pressure but not in subjects with hypertension?,"An association has been described between high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in some studies but not in others. This finding may be explained by a differential impact of inflammation according to the absence or presence of certain co-existing risk factors. Because hypertension may be an effect modifier of inflammation on CVD, our aim was to investigate the relationship between hs-CRP and pre-clinical atherosclerosis in subjects with normal blood pressure and hypertension. Data were analyzed from 14,584 Korean subjects. Subjects were stratified according to: a) 6030 (41.3%) patients with normal blood pressure (<120/80 mmHg), b) 5630 (38.6%) patients with pre-hypertension (120-139 mmHg and 80-89 mmHg) and c) 2924 (20.0%) patients with hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg). Prevalence and odds ratio for the association between increased hs-CRP (>2 mg/L) and presence of CAC (coronary artery calcium) were calculated. In both normal and pre-hypertensive groups, the prevalence of CAC >0 was higher in subjects with increased hs-CRP concentrations (>2 mg/L). Adjusting for age, sex, cerebrovascular accident, coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus, lifestyle, obesity, fasting glucose, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, there was a significant association between higher hs-CRP levels (>2 mg/L) and CAC score in the normal group (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.11-2.16; p = 0.010); a borderline significant association in the pre-hypertensive group (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.99-1.76; p = 0.054); and no association in the hypertensive group (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76-1.33; p = 0.94).",Higher hs-CRP levels (>2 mg/L) are associated with pre-clinical atherosclerosis in subjects with normal blood pressure but not hypertension.,closed_qa
Does [ Elastography show promise in testicular cancer detection ]?,"Elastography is a novel imaging technology that shows promise in the identification of anatomic structures. The widespread use of ultrasound for screening testicular tumors in patients with cancer risk factors highlights unclassified testicular micronodules. We investigated the ability of elastography to accurately diagnose testicular nodules. Patients with clinical testicular nodules were assigned to undergo elastography in a prospective study. The imaging was carried out by a single radiologist using a static elastography unit with a 9-14MHz frequency linear transducer, to identify hardness score, loss of architecture of testicular parenchyma, and surrounding effect. When orchidectomy was required, the corresponding specimens were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining for histologic correlation. We imaged 34 testicular lesions: 26/34 (76%) malignant tumors and 8/34 (24%) non-tumor lesion including 4 hematomas, 3 orchitis and 1 ischemia. Se, Sp, PPV and NPV of hardness in elastography in differentiating between malignant and benign tissue was found to be 96.2%, 37.5%, 83%, and 75%, respectively. Further, for recognizing cancer, the loss of architecture of the testicular parenchyma detecting in elastography was 92.3%, 75%, 92.3%, and 75%, respectively, and the surrounding effect was 84.6%, 87.5%, 95.6% and 63.6%, respectively.",Elastography may be a promising tool at diagnosing testicular tumor when the loss of architecture and the surrounding effect were present. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the utility of elastography is worth pursuing to identify of unclassified testicular micronodules.,closed_qa
Does overexpression of cyclin E isoforms correlate with poor prognosis in rectal cancer?,"To investigate the expression of cyclin E isoforms in rectal cancer and its relations to clinicopathological factors and survival. Cyclin E expression was assessed by Western blot in 360 resected rectal cancer patients of stage I to III. Multivariate analysis was applied to indicate the independent prognostic markers in this cohort. Nineteen percent, 24% or 29% patients exhibited elevated levels of full-length (FL) cyclin E, low-molecular-weight (LMW) cyclin E or total cyclin E in their tumors respectively. Significant correlation was observed between cyclin E expression with blood vessel invasion, deeply invasive tumors, histology grade and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, patients with high levels of LMW-cyclin E or total cyclin E had a poorer 5-year overall survival than did patients with low levels of LMW-cyclin E or total cyclin E. In multivariate analysis, both the LMW-cyclin E and total cyclin E, but not FL-cyclin E, remained independent prognostic indicators in both patients with stage I to III and in those with early stage. Patients with elevated LMW- or total cyclin E levels had a hazard ratio for death from rectal cancer of 6.302 (95% CI, 1.903-17.81, p = 0.001) or 4.332 (95% CI, 1.298-16.362, p = 0.001).","Overexpression of the LMW-cyclin E or total cyclin E is a strong predictor for poorer survival in patients with rectal cancer. Therefore, evaluating cyclin E expression may provide useful prognostic information for resectable rectal cancer patients.",closed_qa
Is leukoaraiosis a risk factor for symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis for acute stroke?,"The aim of the study was to evaluate whether leukoaraiosis (LA) is a risk factor for symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in patients treated with thrombolysis for acute stroke. In this retrospective, multicenter analysis, we evaluated data from acute anterior circulation stroke patients (n=449; <6 hours after symptom onset) treated with thrombolysis. All patients had received standard magnetic resonance imaging evaluation before thrombolysis, including a high-quality T2-weighted sequence. For the analysis, LA in the deep white matter was dichotomized into absent or mild versus moderate or severe (corresponding to Fazekas scores of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 3). The rate of sICH was significantly more frequent in patients with moderate to severe LA of the deep white matter (n=12 of 114; 10.5%) than in patients without relevant LA (n=13 of 335; 3.8%), corresponding to an odds ratio of 2.9 (95% CI, 1.29 to 6.59; P=0.015). In a logistic-regression analysis (including age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation, and type of thrombolytic treatment), LA remained a significant independent risk factor (odds ratio, 2.9; P=0.03).",LA of the deep white matter is an independent risk factor for sICH after thrombolytic treatment for acute stroke.,closed_qa
Does ischemia-reperfusion protect the rat small intestine against subsequent injury?,"It has been suggested that multiple sublethal insults are commonly associated with the development of multiple organ failure (MOF). The gut is considered to be pivotal in the pathogenesis of MOF. This study investigated the effects of repeated ischemia-reperfusion of the rat small intestine. Groups of rats underwent 30 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion or sham operation followed by 24 h of reperfusion. They then received an additional 30 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion and 2 h of reperfusion or sham operation. Small intestine was examined for mucosal injury, neutrophil infiltration, goblet cell number, and generation of the eicosanoids, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene B4. Activation of neutrophils was assessed in systemic venous blood. Animals subjected to two insults of ischemia-reperfusion demonstrated significantly less mucosal injury than animals undergoing one episode of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion, despite increased neutrophil infiltration, leukotriene B4, and activated systemic neutrophils. Goblet cell number was elevated in animals 24 h after the first ischemia-reperfusion insult and remained enhanced after the second episode of ischemia-reperfusion.","The initial episode of ischemia-reperfusion caused an adaptive response associated with cytoarchitectural preservation following the subsequent insult. Increased mucus production was associated with mucosal protection. Nevertheless, repeated ischemia-reperfusion potentiated the local inflammatory response and the systemic activation of neutrophils.",closed_qa
White matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging: a risk factor for stroke in an African population?,"White matter changes are frequently observed incidental findings in elderly individuals. Many studies in Europe and the United States have assessed the association of white matter changes with stroke and other diseases. No similar study has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where risk factors for stroke differ. Our objective was to explore the association between severity of white matter changes (based on visual rating scales) and stroke in a Nigerian population. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 50 patients were retrospectively assessed and scored using 3 different visual rating scales (by Fazekas et al, Scheltens et al, and Manolio et al). The scores were classified as either mild or severe. Clinical indications and MRI scan results were classified into vascular (stroke) and nonvascular groups. The association between severity of white matter changes and stroke on MRI was explored using the Student t test, the Chi-square test, and multiple regression analysis at an alpha level of .05. White matter changes were consistently and significantly more severe in patients with stroke than in patients without stroke (.01 ≤ P<.001; odds ratios 4.58 and 13.3, respectively) using the 3 visual rating scales. This finding was independent of age and gender as confirmed by regression analysis (adjusted odds ratios 4.8 and 9.2; .015 ≤ P ≤ .003).","Our findings suggest that severity of white matter changes in Nigerians may be a significant risk factor for stroke independent of age and gender. Prospective larger studies will be required to confirm its role in predicting stroke and stroke recurrence independent of other vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac diseases.",closed_qa
Does placement of transvenous pacemaker and ICD lead across total chronic occlusions?,"To establish a method of implantation for device leads across total venous occlusions. Indications for pacemaker and implantable cardiac defibrillator implantation continue to expand. Chronic venous occlusions are increasingly encountered with lead placement. Some degree of obstruction can be as high as 13% before device implantation and 50% after transvenous device implantation. We report an approach of venoplasty/dilatation of chronic total occlusions to allow lead placement. From January 1, 2002 through December 16, 2004, 1,356 systems (initial and upgrade) were implanted at the University of Virginia. At the time of device implant, seven patients were noted to have chronic venous occlusions and alternative access was precluded. Four of the seven patients had an existing system; the other three received initial implantations. Subsequently, these seven patients had a 5 Fr catheter placed in the basilic/axillary/subclavian vein and a venogram was obtained to demonstrate the area of chronic occlusion. A guide wire was advanced across the lesion for initial recanalization. Dilatation or venoplasty was performed at the occluded site. A guide wire was retained across the lesion and the patient underwent lead implantation. In all seven patients, recanalization was achieved and leads were successfully placed. There were no complications or damage to the vessels or existing leads.","Venoplasty or dilatation of chronic total venous occlusion is a safe and effective technique, which allows for placement of transvenous leads.",closed_qa
Do interactions between tenofovir and nevirapine in CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages restrict their intracellular accumulation?,"There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and nevirapine, but a higher emergence rate of resistance mutations has been reported when these drugs are coadministered. We sought to examine if there is a potential intracellular interaction that may account for the emergence of resistant virus. Primary CD4+ and CD14+ cells were isolated from healthy volunteer blood. Monocyte-derived macrophages were differentiated from CD14+ cells. Accumulation of radiolabelled tenofovir and nevirapine was then assessed in these cells. We show here that tenofovir and nevirapine immune cell intracellular concentrations are lower when coincubated in CD4+ cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, but not in CD14+ cells.",These data indicate a potential intracellular drug-drug interaction between these drugs that warrants further investigation.,closed_qa
Do lactobacilli expressing variable domain of llama heavy-chain antibody fragments ( lactobodies ) confer protection against rotavirus-induced diarrhea?,"Rotavirus-induced diarrhea poses a worldwide medical problem in causing substantial morbidity and mortality among children in developing countries. We therefore developed a system for passive immunotherapy in which recombinant lactobacilli constitutively express neutralizing variable domain of llama heavy-chain (VHH) antibody fragments against rotavirus. VHH were expressed in Lactobacillus paracasei, in both secreted and cell surface-anchored forms. Electron microscopy was used to investigate the binding efficacy of VHH-expressing lactobacilli. To investigate the in vivo function of VHH-expressing lactobacilli, a mouse pup model of rotavirus infection was used. Efficient binding of the VHH antibody fragments to rotavirus was shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and scanning electron microscopy. VHH fragments expressed by lactobacilli conferred a significant reduction in infection in cell cultures. When administered orally, lactobacilli-producing surface-expressed VHH markedly shortened disease duration, severity, and viral load in a mouse model of rotavirus-induced diarrhea when administered both fresh and in a freeze-dried form.",Transformed lactobacilli may form the basis of a novel form of prophylactic treatment against rotavirus infections and other diarrheal diseases.,closed_qa
Does progastrin expression predispose mice to colon carcinomas and adenomas in response to a chemical carcinogen?,"Processing intermediates of preprogastrin (gly-gastrin and progastrin), termed nonamidated gastrins, are mitogenic for several cell types including colonic epithelial cells. However, presently it is not known if nonamidated gastrins play a role in colon carcinogenesis and if the effects are similar to those of amidated gastrins. Colon carcinogenesis in response to azoxymethane (AOM) was examined in transgenic mice overexpressing either progastrin (hGAS) or amidated gastrin (INS-GAS), compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice. In AOM-treated groups, the total number of tumors per colon was significantly higher in hGAS (4.8+/-0.34) than INS-GAS (3.0+/-0.16) and WT (2.7+/-0.35) mice. Total numbers of adenocarcinomas and adenomas per animal colon were also significantly higher in hGAS than INS-GAS and WT mice. The size of the tumors was greater in hGAS mice, resulting in a significantly higher tumor burden per mouse in the hGAS mice than INS-GAS and WT mice. Although >90% of the tumors were located in the distal half of the colon in INS-GAS and WT mice, a significant number (42%) were present at the proximal end of the colon in hGAS mice.","The results suggest that the risk for developing colon carcinomas and adenomas in response to AOM is significantly increased in mice expressing high levels of progastrin, but not amidated gastrins.",closed_qa
Uterine Length in Adolescents with Developmental Disability: Are Ultrasound Examinations Necessary before Insertion of the Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System?,"(1) To determine if there are any differences in uterine length between adolescents with developmental disability (DD) compared with their normally developing (ND) peers that might necessitate ultrasonography before insertion of levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in patients with DD; and (2) to characterize the LNG-IUS insertion procedure in adolescents with disabilities. This was a retrospective cohort study of 223 female adolescents with or without DDs. Seventy-five adolescents had DD; 33 underwent intrauterine system insertion in the operating room and 42 did not. A comparative cohort of 148 ND adolescents who had pelvic ultrasound examinations for abnormal uterine bleeding were included. The study period was between January 2006 and July 2013 at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Cases were identified from surgical databases and medical records. Mean uterine length on pelvic ultrasound, demographic characteristics (age, age at menarche, time from menarche to ultrasound, weight), and descriptive statistics on intrauterine system insertion. There was a statistically significant difference (P = .03) in uterine length between adolescents with and without DD (6.7 vs 7.1 cm). However, this was not a clinically significant difference because insertion of the LNG-IUS in patients with DD was successful in patients with uteri more than 5 cm long. There was no difference (P = .97) in uterine length of adolescents with DD whether they had LNG-IUS insertion or not (6.7 cm). Adolescents with DD were younger than adolescents without DD at time of ultrasound examination (P = .01). However, among patients with DD, those who underwent intrauterine system insertion were older (P = .001). Incidence of uterine anomaly in patients with DD is low (2.7%) and was the same as in ND adolescents. Rates of complications and expulsions were low and there were no failures of LNG-IUS insertion in adolescents with DD.","Routine pelvic ultrasound examinations are not necessary before insertion of the LNG-IUS for menstrual suppression in adolescents with DD. Renal abnormalities, obstructive symptoms, and very small stature might necessitate imaging. Insertion using anesthesia is often straightforward and successful with minimal complications.",closed_qa
Is myostatin elevated in congenital heart disease and after mechanical unloading?,"Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass whose activity is upregulated in adult heart failure (HF); however, its role in congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. We studied myostatin and IGF-1 expression via Western blot in cardiac tissue at varying degrees of myocardial dysfunction and after biventricular support in CHD by collecting myocardial biopsies from four patient cohorts: A) adult subjects with no known cardiopulmonary disease (left ventricle, LV), (Adult Normal), (n = 5); B) pediatric subjects undergoing congenital cardiac surgery with normal RV size and function (right ventricular outflow tract, RVOT), (n = 3); C) pediatric subjects with worsening but hemodynamically stable LV failure [LV and right ventricle (LV, RV,)] with biopsy collected at the time of orthotopic heart transplant (OHT), (n = 7); and D) pediatric subjects with decompensated bi-ventricular failure on BiVAD support with biopsy collected at OHT (LV, RV, BiVAD), (n = 3). The duration of HF was longest in OHT patients compared to BIVAD. The duration of BiVAD support was 4.3±1.9 days. Myostatin expression was significantly increased in LV-OHT compared to RV-OHT and RVOT, and was increased more than double in decompensated biventricular HF (BiVAD) compared to both OHT and RVOT. An increased myostatin/IGF-1 ratio was associated with ventricular dysfunction.","Myostatin expression in increased in CHD, and the myostatin/IGF-1 ratio increases as ventricular function deteriorates.

Does miR126-5p repression of ALCAM and SetD5 in endothelial cells regulate leucocyte adhesion and transmigration?,"miR126-5p is processed from the miR126-3p/-5p duplex, which is expressed in endothelial cells and gives rise to the guide strand miR126-3p and the passenger strand miR126-5p. miR126-3p has prominent roles in vascular development and diseases, whereas the expression and physiological functions of miR126-5p are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression and role of miR126-5p in blood vessel endothelial cells. miR126-5p is mostly expressed in blood vessel endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches revealed that miR126-5p promotes leucocyte adhesion and represses leucocyte transendothelial migration. Two distinct target genes of miR126-5p in endothelial cells were identified: the activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) gene which codes for an adhesion molecule involved in leucocyte transendothelial migration and SetD5, a gene with previously unknown functions. Using either a blocking antibody or target protectors which specifically disrupt the miRNA/mRNA target pairing, we showed that miR126-5p promotes leucocyte adhesion by controlling the expression of SetD5 and represses transendothelial migration via the regulation of ALCAM. miR126-5p controls ALCAM and SetD5 expression in vivo in separate tissues and regulates leucocyte infiltration into inflamed lungs by repressing ALCAM expression.","miR126-5p is a functional, endothelial-enriched microRNA that participates in the control of leucocyte trafficking by regulating the expression of ALCAM and SetD5.",closed_qa
Polymorphic light eruption and skin cancer prevalence: is one protective against the other?,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVR) interacts with chromophores in cutaneous cells with consequent antigenicity. The normal response to this is a downregulation of immune responsiveness. Failure of the immune system to downregulate and to ignore transient photoantigens in human skin results in polymorphic light eruption (PLE), the commonest of the photodermatoses. UVR initiates and promotes skin cancer (SC): UV-induced immunosuppression permits the expansion of UV-mutated clones of cells which ultimately lead to SC. Because there is increased immune surveillance and resistance to immune suppression following UVR exposure in PLE one might expect a protective effect of PLE against SC and, conversely, a reduced risk of PLE among patients with SC. We therefore constructed a prospective case-control study to see if this were the case. Two groups were studied: a group comprising 214 patients with SC and 210 gender- and aged-matched controls, and a group comprising 100 patients with PLE and 155 gender- and aged-matched controls. Each participant answered a questionnaire aimed at establishing personal and family history of SC and photodermatoses. Skin type and exposure to UVR were also documented. The prevalence of PLE in people with SC was 7.5%, compared with 21.4% for controls (P<0.001). The prevalence of SC in patients with PLE was 4% compared with 7.1% for controls.","Our results show (i) strong evidence of reduced PLE in patients with SC, and (ii) a trend for reduced SC in patients with PLE. The immunological basis of PLE may therefore confer protection against SC.",closed_qa
Does clinician response time for positive blood culture result in a pediatric ICU?,"Positive blood cultures guide clinicians to prescribe specific therapy based on in vitro susceptibility.

Does tGFα and amphiregulin paracrine network promote resistance to EGFR blockade in colorectal cancer cells?,"Targeted inhibition of EGFR with the mAbs cetuximab or panitumumab is a valuable treatment for RAS wild-type colorectal cancers. The efficacy of EGFR blockade is limited by the emergence of acquired resistance often attributed to secondary KRAS mutations. Remarkably, tumor biopsies from resistant patients show that only a fraction of the resilient cells carry KRAS mutations. We hypothesized that a paracrine cross-talk driven by the resistant subpopulation may provide in trans protection of surrounding sensitive cells. Conditioned medium assays and three-dimensional cocultures were used to assess paracrine networks between cetuximab-sensitive and -resistant cells. Production of EGFR ligands by cells sensitive to cetuximab and panitumumab was measured. The ability of recombinant EGFR ligands to protect sensitive cells from cetuximab was assessed. Biochemical activation of the EGFR signaling pathway was measured by Western blotting. Colorectal cancer cells sensitive to EGFR blockade can successfully grow despite cetuximab treatment when in the company of their resistant derivatives. Media conditioned by resistant cells protect sensitive parental cells from cetuximab. EGFR blockade triggers increased secretion of TGFα and amphiregulin. Increased secretion of ligands by resistant cells can sustain EGFR/ERK signaling in sensitive cells.","Colorectal cancer cells that develop resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab secrete TGFα and amphiregulin, which protect the surrounding cells from EGFR blockade. This paracrine protective mechanism might be therapeutically exploitable.",closed_qa
Are sCF and IL-31 rather than IL-17 and BAFF potential indicators in patients with allergic asthma?,"Although the prevalence of allergic asthma increased quickly in the past decade, the diagnostic criteria have not been well established. The aim of the present study was to explore whether stem cell factor (SCF), B cell-activating factor (BAFF), and cytokines interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-31 are usable parameters for the diagnosis of allergic asthmatics. Blood samples were collected from patients with allergic asthma, control patients, and healthy control subjects. The serum concentrations of SCF, BAFF, IL-17, and IL-31 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The corresponding mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. A good correlation existed between protein levels of SCF and IL-31 and their mRNA levels (SCF: r = 0.6162; IL-31: r = 0.5463). The serum concentrations of SCF and IL-31 in allergic asthmatic patients, but not control patients, were significantly higher than those in normal control subjects (SCF: median 1.83 vs 0.85 ng/ml, P < 0.01; IL-31: 50.15 vs 10.01 pg/ml, P < 0.001). Consistently, the levels of SCF and IL-31 mRNAs in allergic asthmatic patients' PBMCs were also significantly higher than those in normal control subjects (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively).",These findings suggest that allergic asthma is characterized by an elevation of cytokines SCF and IL-31 and the measurement of their expression at either protein level in serum or mRNA level in PBMCs will be a valuable parameter for the diagnosis of allergic asthma.,closed_qa
Can transvaginal fetal biometry be considered a useful tool for early detection of skeletal dysplasias in high-risk patients?,"To evaluate the possibility of an early diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias in high-risk patients. A total of 149 consecutive, uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at 9-13 weeks' amenorrhea, with certain menstrual history and regular cycles, were investigated with transvaginal ultrasound to establish the relationship between femur length and menstrual age, biparietal diameter and crown-rump length, using a polynomial regression model. A further eight patients with previous skeletal dysplasias in a total of 13 pregnancies were evaluated with serial examinations every 2 weeks from 10-11 weeks. A significant correlation between femur length and crown-rump length and biparietal diameter was found, whereas none was observed between femur length and menstrual age. Of the five cases with skeletal dysplasias, only two (one with recurrent osteogenesis imperfecta and one with recurrent achondrogenesis) were diagnosed in the first trimester.","An early evaluation of fetal morphology in conjunction with the use of biometric charts of femur length against crown-rump length and femur length against biparietal diameter may be crucial for early diagnosis of severe skeletal dysplasias. By contrast, in less severe cases, biometric evaluation appears to be of no value for diagnosis.",closed_qa
Is intercostal block for pain management in thoracic surgery more successful than epidural anaesthesia?,"Currently epidural anesthesia is the gold standard for postoperative pain management in thoracic surgery. In a prospective randomised study, the effect of an intercostal nerve block applied at the end of the operation was compared to that of epidural anesthesia. Thirty patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomised to each group. Patients with resection of the parietal pleura, rib resection and rethoracotomy were excluded from the study. Both groups received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs every 8h as a baseline analgesic medication and were allowed to ask for supplemental subcutaneous opiate injection, limited to four injections per day. The patients in the epidural catheter group (group I) were provided with a motor pump allowing continuous infusion of bupivacain 0.125% and 2mg fentanyl/ml at a dosage of 6-10 ml per hour, dependent on the pain level over a period of 5 days. The patients of the second group (group II) received an intercostal nerve block at the end of the operation reaching from the third to the ninth intercostal space with 20 ml 0.5% bubivacaine. Pain was evaluated with a pain score ranging from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) twice daily in relaxed position and during physical activity like coughing. On the fifth postoperative day, the patients were asked specific questions concerning the subjective pain experience. Costs of both treatments were calculated. Mean pain values and costs of both groups were compared by t-tests for independent samples. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Eighteen male and 12 female patients, aged between 35 and 71 years (mean 59) were included in the study. Nineteen patients had lobectomy, five bilobectomy, two decortication and three wedge resection. There were 22 right sided and eight left sided procedures. In group I, the mean pain score on the operation day was 3.95 in relaxed position and 6.33 during physical activity like coughing. The mean pain score during the following 4 days was 2.19 in relaxed position and 4.28 with activity. Three patients required additional subcutaneous opiate injection. In group II, the mean score on the operation day was 2.0 in relaxed position and 3.5 during activity. The mean pain score during the next 4 days was 2.84 in relaxed position and 5.65 with activity. Twelve patients received subcutaneous opiates. In both groups, no complications were observed.COSTS: The costs for treatment of one patient was 105 in group I and 33 in group II. Patients' satisfaction was equal in both groups, there were no differences in terms of outcome and recovery.",Pain management by intercostal block was superior during the first 24h after surgery whereas on the second day after surgery pain control was significantly better achieved by the epidural catheter in relaxed position. A combination of both forms of anaesthesia seems to be an ideal pain management in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.,closed_qa
Is iodine -131 metaiodobenzylguanidine an effective treatment for malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma?,"Iodine 131-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) has been applied to the palliative treatment of metastatic pheochromocytoma in small studies. We report our institutional experience for the treatment of metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. We performed a retrospective review of 33 patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma (n=22) and paraganglioma (n=11) treated at our institution with (131)I-MIBG over a 10-year period. Patients received a mean dose of 388+/-131 mCi (131)I-MIBG. Median survival after treatment was 4.7 years. Most patients experienced a symptomatic response leading to an improved survival (4.7 years vs 1.8 years, P<.01). Patients with a measurable hormone response demonstrated an increased survival in comparison to those with no response (4.7 years vs 2.6 years, P=.01). Patients who received a high dose (>500 mCi) as their initial therapy also had improved survival (3.8 years vs 2.8 years, P=.02).","These data support (131)I-MIBG treatment for select patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma. In our experience, prolonged survival was best predicted by symptomatic and hormone response to (131)I-MIBG treatment. An initial dose of 500 mCi may be optimal. The benefit of (131)I-MIBG treatment for metastatic pheochromocytoma must also be weighed against its side effects.",closed_qa
Does acute Exercise decrease Tribbles Homolog 3 Protein Levels in the Hypothalamus of Obese Rats?,"This study aims to evaluate the effects of acute exercise on tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) protein levels and on the interaction between TRB3 and Akt proteins in the hypothalamus of obese rats. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between TRB3 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and verified whether an acute exercise session influences them. In the first part of the study, the rats were divided into three groups: control (lean), fed standard rodent chow; DIO, fed a high-fat diet; and DIO-EXE, fed a high-fat diet and submitted to a swimming acute exercise protocol. In the second part of the study, we used three other groups: control (lean) group receiving an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of vehicle, lean group receiving an i.c.v. infusion of thapsigargin, and lean group receiving an i.c.v. infusion of thapsigargin and performing an acute exercise session. Four hours after the exercise session, food intake was measured, and the hypothalamus was dissected and separated for subsequent protein analysis by immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The acute exercise session reduced TRB3 protein levels, disrupted the interaction between TRB3 and Akt proteins, increased the phosphorylation of Foxo1, and restored the anorexigenic effects of insulin on the hypothalamus of DIO rats. Interestingly, the suppressive effects of acute exercise on TRB3 protein levels may be related, at least in part, to decreased ER stress (evaluated though pancreatic ER kinase phosphorylation and C/EBP homologous protein levels) in the hypothalamus.",Exercise-mediated reduction of hypothalamic TRB3 protein levels may be associated with reduction of ER stress. These data provide a new mechanism by which an acute exercise session improves insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and restores food intake control in obesity.,closed_qa
Does tissue expression of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protein correlate with histological or clinical features in patients with chronic hepatitis C?,"In chronic hepatitis B, the HBcAg viral protein in liver tissue demonstrates a positive correlation with serum aminotransferase levels, serum hepatitis B viral DNA, and histological activities. Little is known if similar relationships exist for chronic hepatitis C. This study attempted to determine if expression of the hepatocyte NS3 protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV-NS3) was correlated with the serum HCV-RNA load, hepatitis activity, or other clinical parameters. Clinical and histological data of 214 patients with chronic hepatitis C were retrospectively reviewed. A mouse monoclonal antibody was used to detect HCV-NS3 in hepatocytes. The staining intensity was scored semiquantitatively as 0~3+, and its correlations with the serum HCV-RNA load, hepatitis activity, and other clinical parameters were analyzed. In total, 202 (94%) of the 214 liver biopsies were positive for HCV-NS3, and the intensity of HCV-NS3 staining was 0 in 12 (6%), 1+ in 181 (84%), and 2+ in 21 patients (10%). The intensity of HCV-NS3 expression in the samples did not correlate with patient age (p = 0.302, ANOVA), patient gender (p = 0.130, Fisher's exact test), the alanine transaminase level (p = 0.177, ANOVA), serum HCV-RNA level (p = 0.305, ANOVA), HCV antibody titer (p = 0.139, Chi-squared test), hepatitis activity index score (p = 0.861, Chisquared test), or sustained viral response rate (p = 0.861, Chi-squared test).","This HCV-NS3 immunohistochemical staining method was reliable for detecting HCV in liver specimens. Hepatocyte expression of HCV-NS3 was not correlated with the serum viral load, severity of hepatic injury, or treatment response.",closed_qa
Do prophylactic antibiotics alter the bacteriology of infected necrosis in severe acute pancreatitis?,"Use of appropriate prophylactic antibiotics has been shown to decrease infectious complications and mortality rate in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, but its influence on the bacteriology of secondary pancreatic infection is poorly defined. Operative cultures from 61 consecutive patients with pancreatic necrosis treated during routine prophylactic antibiotic use (1993-2001) were compared with 34 consecutive patients with necrosis treated before routine antibiotic use (1977-1992). The two groups of patients were similar in demographics, etiology of pancreatitis, and severity of illness. All patients in the antibiotic group received prophylactic antibiotics compared with only 38% (13 of 34) in the control group. Routine broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics altered the bacteriology of secondary pancreatic infection in severe acute pancreatitis from predominantly gram-negative coliforms (56% versus 26%, p = 0.005) to predominately gram-positive organisms (23% versus 52%, p = 0.009) without a significant increase in either the rate of beta-lactam resistance or fungal infections. The overall hospital stay in patients treated with prophylactic antibiotics was significantly reduced (61 +/- 24 days versus 41 +/- 28 days, p = 0.002), and there was a trend toward a decline in mortality rate in the antibiotic treatment group.",Routine broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotic use has altered the bacteriology of secondary pancreatic infection in severe acute pancreatitis from predominantly gram-negative coliforms to predominantly gram-positive organisms without altering the rate of beta-lactam resistance or fungal superinfection.,closed_qa
Does soluble thrombomodulin attenuate sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in rat through suppression of high mobility group box 1?,"Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a drug-induced liver injury caused by anticancer treatment such as oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases. SOS is also associated with postoperative morbidity after hepatectomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) in a monocrotaline (MCT)-induced SOS model in rats. Rats were administered rTM by intravenous injection (3 mg/kg) and subcutaneous injection (3 mg/kg) concurrently with MCT administration. Other rats received the same volume of normal saline (NS) and MCT. Liver tissue and blood were collected 48 h after MCT administration to evaluate SOS. Survival after 30% partial hepatectomy was also investigated in both groups. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry were used to examine sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs). Serum concentrations of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and neutrophil accumulation were also measured. In the NS group, liver histology showed SOS phenotypes. In the rTM group, these changes were suppressed, total SOS scores were significantly lower, and serum transaminase levels were significantly reduced compared with the NS group. Survival after 30% hepatectomy was significantly higher in the rTM group (57% vs. 22%, P = 0.0070). Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed a protective effect of rTM on SECs. rTM also attenuated the serum HMGB1 level (9.2 vs. 19.6 ng/ml, P = 0.0086), active neutrophil recruitment and myeloperoxidase activity.","rTM preserved SECs and attenuated MCT-induced SOS in rats through suppression of circulatory HMGB1 and neutrophil accumulation, resulting in improved survival after hepatectomy.",closed_qa

Is lobectomy necessary in the treatment of pulmonary hydatid cysts?,"Hydatidosis is endemic in Turkey and many other areas of the world. The definitive treatment for pulmonary hydatidosis is surgical. The purpose of this study was the review of surgical therapy of our patients with pulmonary hydatid disease and the necessity of lobectomy. We reviewed 107 patients: 26 of whom were women and 81 were men. The median age was 30 years (range, 7-57 years). Chest roentgenogram, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography of the chest and upper abdomen were carried out as diagnostic study. All patients underwent thoracotomy and cystotomy with or without capitonnage. Four patients had two cysts in the same lobe and one patient had three cysts (one perforated and two intact) in the left lower lobe (4.6%). In nine patients, the cysts were>10 cm in diameter (8.4%). In 18 patients, the cysts were suppurative (16.8%). None of the patients required lobectomy. Of the 107 patients, prolonged air leaks (n = 8), atelectasis (n = 3) and empyema (n = 3; two had empyema preoperatively because of pleural perforation of cysts and the other had prolonged air leak) were observed in the postoperative period. There was no death.","The effective treatment of hydatid cysts in the lung is the complete excision of the cyst with maximum preservation of lung parenchyma. We believe that the decision of lobectomy must be taken very carefully, even in the case of infected hydatid cysts, atelectasis, giant cysts and multiple cysts in the same lobe.",closed_qa
Does 17β-Estradiol attenuate cytokine-induced nitric oxide production in rat hepatocyte?,"Nitric oxide (NO) regulation during shock and sepsis is complex. NO production by endothelial NO synthase maintains microvascular perfusion and prevents shock-induced organ injury. However, the overproduction of NO by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) contributes to liver dysfunction after shock and is associated with increased tissue damage and mortality. Estrogen improves organ function and outcome after shock and sepsis, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that 17β-estradiol would improve organ function by regulating the production of hepatocyte NO. Isolated rat hepatocytes were stimulated in vitro with pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce NO synthesis with or without estrogen. Nitrite was detected after 24 hours. INOS protein was determined using Western blot analysis. Cytokine stimulation increased nitrite and iNOS protein in a dose-dependent manner. The cytokine-induced nitrite increase was significantly decreased by estrogen. iNOS expression was also diminished in cultures with the higher doses of estrogen.",17β-Estradiol decreases cytokine-stimulated iNOS expression and NO production.

Do serum fibrosis markers identify patients with mild and progressive hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation?,"Significant fibrosis (fibrosis stage [F] >or= 2) and portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] >or= 6 mm Hg) in patients 1 year after liver transplantation indicate progressive hepatitis C recurrence. This study evaluated whether serum fibrosis markers can predict hepatitis C recurrence during the first year after liver transplantation. Hyaluronic acid, amino-terminal propeptide of type-III-procollagen, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase type-1 concentrations were measured in serum samples from 133 patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) at 3, 6, and 12 months after liver transplantation; routine laboratory tests were also performed. Liver biopsy samples (n = 133) and HVPGs (n = 94) were analyzed 1 year after transplantation. Sixteen patients who were not infected with HCV served as controls. An algorithm, including the 3 markers (3-M-ALG) and 3 published scores (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio, AST-to-platelet ratio index, and Benlloch) were analyzed. One year after liver transplantation, 50 patients (38%) had significant fibrosis (F >or= 2) and 31 (32%) had an HVPG >or= 6 mm Hg. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of the 3-M-ALG used to identify F >or= 2 at 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation (0.67, 0.77, and 0.78) and of those with HVPG >or= 6 at the same time points (0.75, 0.87, and 0.90) were significantly higher than values obtained with the 3 published scores. At 12 months, a 3-M-ALG >or= 2 identified most patients at risk of decompensation/death.",Serum markers can accurately discriminate between patients with mild and progressive hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation.,closed_qa
Is anosmia very common in the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer 's disease?,"Olfactory abnormalities are reported in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Anosmia appears to be common in dementia with Lewy bodies but not in pure Alzheimer's disease. To determine whether anosmia improves discrimination between the Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease and ""pure"" Alzheimer's disease. 106 cases of necropsy confirmed pure Alzheimer's disease (n = 89) or LBV (n = 17) were reviewed. All had received butanol odour threshold testing. Anosmia was defined as a score < or = 1.0 on a 0-9 point scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to model potential predictors (for example, parkinsonism, smoking, hallucinations) of neuropathological diagnosis and anosmia. LBV cases had an increased prevalence of anosmia (65%) compared with Alzheimer's disease (23%; odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, p = 0.00045), or normal elderly people (6.7%). Within the dementia cases, the negative predictive value (92%) and specificity (78%) of anosmia were both good; sensitivity for detecting LBV was 65%, but the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 35%. Logistic regression models showed anosmia (OR = 5.4, p = 0.005) and visual hallucinations (OR = 7.3, p = 0.007) were strong independent predictors of Lewy body pathology. When anosmia was added as a core feature to consensus diagnostic criteria for probable Lewy body dementia, five additional cases of LBV were detected (29% increased sensitivity), but with four additional false positives (1% increased discrimination, 4% decreased specificity, 33% decreased PPV).","Anosmia is very common in LBV. Adding anosmia as a core feature improved sensitivity for detecting LBV, but did not improve discrimination between Alzheimer's disease and LBV owing to a concomitant increase in false positives.",closed_qa
Does long-term use of autologous serum 50 % eye drop for the treatment of dry eye disease?,"The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of 50% autologous serum (AS) eye drops after long-term use in a large cohort of patients with dry eyes. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients treated with 50% AS eye drops at our institution between June 2008 and January 2013. Records were reviewed for clinical history, systemic risk factors, dry eye etiology, patients' symptoms, and adverse events. Ocular surface evaluation included Schirmer testing with topical anesthesia, fluorescein staining, and ocular surface disease index. Data were reviewed at initial visit, 1 month, and every 3 to 6 months during treatment with AS. Paired t tests were performed to compare the progression of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. A total of 123 eyes of 63 patients were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-48 months). Corneal fluorescein staining (mean baseline, 1.77 ± 1.1) improved at the 3- to <6-month, 6- to <12-month, and final follow-up (mean: 1.2 ± 1.0, 1.3 ± 1.0, and 1.1 ± 1.1; P = 0.003, 0.017, and 0.0003, respectively). Schirmer scores (mean baseline, 6.6 ± 6.5 mm) improved at the 12- to 24-month follow-up (mean = 10.7 ± 11.4, P = 0.03), whereas ocular surface disease index scores (mean baseline, 54.1 ± 22.3) improved at the 3- to <6- and 6- to <12-month follow-up (mean: 49.5 ± 8.2 and 39.3 ± 21.4, P = 0.029 and 0.003, respectively).

Is risk of axillary lymph node metastasis associated with proximity of breast cancer to the skin?,"Risk of axillary lymph node metastasis, the most important predictor of disease-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients, is estimated primarily from histologic features of the primary cancer including tumor size, histologic type and grade, and hormone receptor expression. Based upon a clinical impression, and research showing that palpable cancers are more likely to be node positive, we hypothesized that primary breast cancers more proximal to the skin of the breast are more likely to be positive for axillary lymph node metastasis. This is a retrospective medical record review of 209 women with stage T1 or T2 (</=5.0 cm) invasive breast cancer who received dedicated breast ultrasound at a single mammography clinic in Columbia, South Carolina, between 1997 and 2002. None of the 26 cancers more than 14 mm from the skin had metastasized to axillary lymph nodes. In logistic regression modeling only tumor size, histologic grade and tumor proximity to the skin (as a categorical variable) were significantly associated with odds of axillary metastasis. Among cancers within 14 mm of the skin, proximity was not an independent predictor.",Stage T1 and T2 breast cancers located less proximally to the skin may be less likely to spread to the axillary lymph nodes. We observed what appears to be a threshold at approximately 14 mm from the skin (based upon this group of patients): none of 26 cancers below this level had spread to axillary nodes. Further research is needed to confirm these provocative findings.,closed_qa
Hospitalization: Are We Missing an Opportunity to Identify Food Insecurity in Children?,"Food security is the ability to access sufficient food to maintain a healthy, active life. Previous studies link food insecurity with adverse health outcomes. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of food insecurity, identify sociodemographic risk factors, and quantify receipt of public nutrition assistance among recently hospitalized children in the United States. Cross-sectional analyses of a representative sample of the US population aged 0 to 19 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007 to 2012 (N = 12,627). Consistent with previous literature, households were defined as food insecure if they answered ""yes"" to 3 or more of 18 food security questions. Children were considered recently hospitalized if admitted overnight in the past year (n = 706). Descriptive statistics characterized food insecurity and receipt of nutrition assistance. Multiple logistic regression analyses evaluated associations of food insecurity with age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, family income, and hospitalization. One-quarter (25.3%) of recently hospitalized children lived in food insecure households. More than one-third of recently hospitalized low-income, uninsured, or Hispanic children lived in food insecure households. In the adjusted analysis, recently hospitalized low-income children and girls had significantly greater odds of living in food insecure households. Of potentially eligible hospitalized children, 26.9% had not received Women, Infants, and Children benefits and 31.0% had not received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the past year.",One-quarter of recently hospitalized children lived in food insecure households. Many eligible families were not enrolled in public nutrition programs.

Does joint space height correlate with arthroscopic grading of wrist arthritis?,"Osteoarthritis of the radiocarpal joints is commonly encountered by hand surgeons. To date, there is no well-defined method of radiographically grading osteoarthritis of the wrist. Preoperative radiographs of 48 patients undergoing wrist arthroscopy were evaluated retrospectively. Images were graded subjectively by five surgeons based on overall severity of arthritis, osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and subchondral sclerosis. The joint space height (JSH) ratio was calculated by measuring the space of the mid-radioscaphoid and mid-radiolunate joints and dividing each by the height of the capitate. Arthroscopic grading of arthritis was obtained from operative records and compared to subjective and objective grades. ANOVA testing evaluated for statistical significance with p < 0.05. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability was determined using Pearson's correlation analysis and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Objective measurement using the JSH ratio demonstrated a significant decrease as arthroscopic arthritis grade increased for both radioscaphoid and radiolunate joints. Subjective grading of radioscaphoid and radiolunate joints was able to detect moderate/severe, but not mild arthritis. Subjective grading underestimated the degree of arthritis, particularly in the radiolunate joint. Inter-rater reliability was better for objective compared to subjective grading.","Subjective grading of wrist arthritis can detect moderate/severe radiocarpal arthritis but poorly evaluates early arthritis and underestimates severity. Objective grading using the JSH ratio accurately grades radioscaphoid arthritis and detects early radiolunate arthritis. The JSH ratio more accurately assesses radiocarpal arthritis compared with subjective grading. As there currently is no accepted method to radiographically grade wrist arthritis, the JSH ratio represents a promising option.",closed_qa
Do epilepsy patients treated with antiepileptic drug therapy exhibit compromised ocular perfusion characteristics?,"Reduced cerebral blood flow and decreased cerebral glucose metabolism have been identified in patients with epilepsy treated with antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular haemodynamics are similarly reduced in patients with epilepsy treated with AEDs. Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure retinal capillary microvascular flow, volume, and velocity in the temporal neuroretinal rim of 14 patients diagnosed with epilepsy (mean age, 42.0 +/- 0.9 years). These values were compared with those of an age- and gender-matched normal subject group (n = 14; mean age, 41.7 +/- 0.3 years). Student's unpaired two-tailed t tests were used to compare ocular blood-flow parameters between the epilepsy and normal subject groups (p < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). A significant reduction in retinal blood volume (p = 0.001), flow (p = 0.003), and velocity (p = 0.001) was observed in the epilepsy group (13.52 +/- 3.75 AU, 219.14 +/- 76.61 AU, and 0.77 +/- 0.269 AU, respectively) compared with the normal subject group (19.02 +/- 5.11 AU, 344.03 +/- 93.03 AU, and 1.17 +/- 0.301 AU, respectively). Overall, the percentage mean difference between the epilepsy and normal groups was 36.31% for flow, 28.92% for volume, and 34.19% for velocity.","Patients with epilepsy exhibit reduced neuroretinal capillary blood flow, volume, and velocity compared with normal subjects.

Is lGR5 associated with tumor aggressiveness in papillary thyroid cancer?,"Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) is a cancer stem cell marker and a down-stream target in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In human papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), over activation of Wnt/β-catenin has been associated with tumor aggressiveness. Using established human cell lines (TPC-1, KTC-1, Nthy-ori-3-1), we report LGR5 and R-spondin (RSPO1-3) overexpression in PTC and manipulate LGR5 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling via both pharmacologic and genetic interventions. We test the association of LGR5 tumor expression with markers of PTC aggressiveness using a Discovery Cohort (n = 26 patients) and a Validation Cohort (n = 157 patients). Lastly, we explore the association between LGR5 and the BRAFV600E mutation (n = 33 patients). Our results reveal that LGR5 and its ligand, RSPO, are overexpressed in human PTC, whereby Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates LGR5 expression and promotes cellular migration. In two separate cohorts of patients, LGR5 and RSPO2 were associated with markers of tumor aggressiveness including: lymph node metastases, vascular invasion, increased tumor size, aggressive histology, advanced AJCC TNM stage, microscopic extra thyroidal extension, capsular invasion, and macroscopic invasion. As a biomarker, LGR5 positivity predicts lymph node metastasis with 95.5% sensitivity (95% CI 88.8%-98.7%) and 61% specificity (95% CI: 48.4%-72.4%) and has a negative predictive value (NPV) of 91.3% (95% CI 79.2%-97.5%) for lymph node metastatic disease. In human PTC, LGR5 is also strongly associated with the BRAFV600E mutation (p = 0.005).",We conclude that overexpression of LGR5 is associated with markers of tumor aggressiveness in human PTC. LGR5 may serve as a future potential biomarker for patient risk stratification and loco regional metastases in PTC.,closed_qa
Does calpain inhibition prevent sinusoidal endothelial cell apoptosis in the cold ischemic rat liver?,"Cold preservation of the liver followed by reperfusion results in sinusoidal endothelial cell (SEC) apoptosis. Calpain-like activity is dramatically increased during reperfusion and inhibition of calpains results in lower graft injury and longer survival. Recently, calpains have been implicated in inducing apoptosis. Our aim was to determine the effect of calpain inhibition on SEC apoptosis. Livers were stored in the University of Wisconsin solution for 24 hr (survival conditions) and 40 hr (nonsurvival conditions) and ex vivo reperfused for 1 hr at 37 degrees C. Calpain-like activity was inhibited in some experiments using an i.p. injection of a selective inhibitor 2 hr before explantation. Apoptosis was quantified using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans. ferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay. Cross-inhibition by the inhibitor was determined for caspases 1 and 3. Apoptosis of exclusively the SEC was a key feature of reperfusion injury after both storage periods in University of Wisconsin solution after 1 hr normothermic reperfusion. Inhibition of calpain activity with Cbz-Val-Phe methyl ester resulted in a 50% reduction of apoptotic SEC in the 40-hr preserved liver, and an almost complete abrogation of SEC apoptosis after 24 hr preservation. Only minimal cross-inhibition of caspases was determined at high concentrations in vitro by the calpain inhibitor.","Apoptosis of exclusively SEC is a key feature of reperfusion injury partially mediated through calpain-dependent processes. Calpain inhibition reduces the number of apoptotic SEC. Based on these data and our previous work, calpain inhibition may prove to be useful in clinical transplantation.",closed_qa
Does physical training improve endothelial function in patients with chronic heart failure?,"Chronic heart failure is associated with endothelial dysfunction including impaired endothelium-mediated, flow-dependent dilation (FDD). Since endothelial function is thought to play an important role in coordinating tissue perfusion and modulating arterial compliance, interventions to improve endothelial dysfunction are imperative. To assess the potential of physical training to restore FDD, 12 patients with chronic heart failure were studied and compared with FDD of 7 age-matched normal subjects. With a recently developed high-resolution ultrasound system, diameters of radial artery were measured at rest, during reactive hyperemia (with increased flow causing endothelium-mediated dilation), and during sodium nitroprusside, causing endothelium-independent dilation. Determination of FDD was repeated after intra-arterial infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 7 mumol/min) to inhibit endothelial synthesis and release of nitric oxide. The protocol was performed at baseline, after 4 weeks of daily handgrip training, and 6 weeks after cessation of the training program. FDD was impaired in heart failure patients compared with normal subjects. L-NMMA attenuated FDD, indicating that the endothelial release of nitric oxide is involved in FDD. Physical training restored FDD in patients with heart failure. In particular, the portion of FDD inhibited by L-NMMA (representing FDD mediated by nitric oxide) was significantly higher after physical training (8-minute occlusion: 8.0 +/- 1% versus 5.4 +/- 0.9%; P < .05; normal subjects: 9.2 +/- 1%).","These results indicate that physical training restores FDD in patients with chronic heart failure, possibly by enhanced endothelial release of nitric oxide.",closed_qa
Does varicella zoster virus trigger the immunopathology of giant cell arteritis?,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a severe form of vasculitis in the elderly. The recent discovery of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the temporal arteries and adjacent skeletal muscle of patients with GCA, and the rationale and strategy for antiviral and corticosteroid treatment for GCA are reviewed. The clinical features of GCA include excruciating headache/head pain, often with scalp tenderness, a nodular temporal arteries and decreased temporal artery pulsations. Jaw claudication, night sweats, fever, malaise, and a history of polymyalgia rheumatica (aching and stiffness of large muscles primarily in the shoulder girdle, upper back, and pelvis without objective signs of weakness) are common. ESR and CRP are usually elevated. Diagnosis is confirmed by temporal artery biopsy which reveals vessel wall damage and inflammation, with multinucleated giant cells and/or epithelioid macrophages. Skip lesions are common. Importantly, temporal artery biopsies are pathologically negative in many clinically suspect cases. This review highlights recent virological findings in temporal arteries from patients with pathologically verified GCA and in temporal arteries from patients who manifest clinical and laboratory features of GCA, but whose temporal artery biopsies (Bx) are pathologically negative for GCA (Bx-negative GCA). Virological analysis revealed that VZV is present in most GCA-positive and GCA-negative temporal artery biopsies, mostly in skip areas that correlate with adjacent GCA pathology.","The presence of VZV in Bx-positive and Bx-negative GCA temporal arteries indicates that VZV triggers the immunopathology of GCA. However, the presence of VZV in about 20% of temporal artery biopsies from non-GCA postmortem controls also suggests that VZV alone is not sufficient to produce disease. Treatment trials should be performed to determine if antiviral agents confer additional benefits to corticosteroids in both Bx-positive and Bx-negative GCA patients. These studies should also examine whether oral antiviral agents and corticosteroids are as effective as intravenous acyclovir and corticosteroids. Appropriate dosage and duration of treatment also remain to be determined.",closed_qa
Do high admission levels of γ-glutamyltransferase predict poor myocardial perfusion after primary percutaneous intervention?,"This retrospective study aimed to investigate the relationship between admission levels of serum y-glutamyltransferase and poor myocardial perfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Reperfusion injury caused by free radical release and increased oxidative stress is responsible for the pathophysiology of the no-reflow phenomenon in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Serum γ-glutamyltransferase is an established marker of increased oxidative stress. The study population consisted of 80 patients (64 men and 16 women, mean age = 67.5 + 6.6 years) with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 0/1 flow pre-procedurally. The patients were divided into two groups according to thrombolysis in myocardial perfusion grades that were assessed immediately following primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The two groups (group 1 and group 2) each consisted of 40 patients with thrombolysis in myocardial perfusion grades 0-1 and thrombolysis in myocardial perfusion grades 2-3, respectively. Admission pain to balloon time, γ-glutamyltransferase and creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme levels of group 1 patients were significantly higher than those of group 2 patients. Pain to balloon time, γ-glutamyltransferase, peak creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme, low left ventricular ejection fraction and poor pre-procedural thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade were significantly associated with poor myocardial perfusion by univariate analysis. However, only pain to balloon time and γ-glutamyltransferase levels showed a significant independent association with poor myocardial perfusion by backward logistic regression analysis. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated as 4.92 for pain to balloon time and 1.13 for γ-glutamyltransferase.","High admission γ-glutamyltransferase levels are associated with poor myocardial perfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, particularly in patients with prolonged pain to balloon time.",closed_qa
Does the tick-derived inhibitor Ixolaris prevent tissue factor signaling on tumor cells?,"Tissue factor (TF) is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells and correlated with more aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis. In addition to promoting coagulation-dependent metastasis and cancer-associated thrombosis, tumor cell-expressed TF mediates direct cell signaling involving the protease-activated receptor (PAR) 2. Ixolaris is a tick-derived inhibitor of the TF-factor (F)VIIa-Xa coagulation initiation complex which blocks primary tumor growth and angiogenesis in glioblastoma and melanoma models. In this study we address the anti-tumor effects of Ixolaris in TF-VIIa-PAR2 signaling-dependent breast cancer models, a xenograft model of highly aggressive human MDA-MB-231 mfp cells and a syngeneic model of PAR2-deficient and replete PyMT mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Ixolaris potently inhibited the procoagulant activity of human MDA-MB-231mfp or murine PyMT breast cancer cells. Ixolaris blocked signaling by the ternary TF-FVIIa-FXa complex, and, surprisingly, at higher concentrations also the binary TF-FVIIa complex on MDA-MB-231 cells. We show that Ixolaris interacts with certain residues in the human VIIa protease domain that are involved in PAR2 cleavage. In contrast to human VIIa, Ixolaris was a poor inhibitor of murine TF-FVIIa signaling and did not attenuate PAR2-dependent tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer progression.",These data show that Ixolaris inhibits PAR2 cleavage specifically by human TF signaling complexes and suggest that Ixolaris may block tumor growth of human cell models with ectopic FVIIa expression through inhibition of direct TF-FVIIa-PAR2 signaling as well as its anticoagulant activity.,closed_qa
Is mechanical tricuspid valve replacement superior in patients younger than 65 years who need long-term anticoagulation?,"We evaluated long-term results of tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) with mechanical valves and bioprostheses in patients less than 65 years old who needed anticoagulation therapy irrespective of TVR. Among 156 patients who underwent TVR from January 1996 to April 2010, 119 patients younger than 65 years who needed anticoagulation therapy independent of the TVR were studied. Anticoagulation therapy was needed owing to left-sided mechanical valves (n = 11), atrial fibrillation (n = 13), or both (n = 95). Seventy patients underwent mechanical TVR, and 49 underwent bioprosthetic TVR. The follow-up duration was 68 ± 38 months. Propensity score-adjusted analyses were performed. Early postoperative outcomes were similar between groups, with an operative morality rate of 6.7% (8 of 119). Overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 86.4% and 80.3%, respectively. There were no differences in propensity score-adjusted overall survival rates between the two groups (p = 0.291). Freedom from the composite endpoint of thrombosis, embolism, and bleeding was lower in the mechanical TVR group than in the bioprosthetic TVR group (76.3% and 70.0% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, versus 97.6% and 97.6%, p = 0.020). Five- and 10-year valve-related event-free survivals were also lower in the mechanical TVR group than in the bioprosthetic TVR group, although not statistically significant (75.0% and 61.7% versus 89.2% and 80.3%, p = 0.129).","Even in younger patients who need anticoagulation therapy irrespective of TVR, mechanical TVR is not superior because of increased occurrence of valve-related events, especially the composite of thrombosis, embolism, and bleeding.",closed_qa
Does ultraearly hematoma growth predict poor outcome after acute intracerebral hemorrhage?,"To investigate the impact of the adjustment of initial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume by onset-to-imaging time (ultraearly hematoma growth [uHG]) on further hematoma enlargement and outcome in patients with acute ICH. We studied 133 patients with acute (<6 hours) supratentorial ICH. Patients underwent baseline and 24-hour CT scans for ICH volume measurement, and a CT angiography (CTA) for the detection of the spot sign. We defined uHG as the relation between baseline ICH volume/onset-to-imaging time, hematoma growth (HG) as hematoma enlargement >33% or >6 mL at 24 hours, early neurologic deterioration (END) as increase ≥4 points in the NIH Stroke Scale score or death at 24 hours, and poor long-term outcome as modified Rankin Scale score >2 at 3 months. The uHG was significantly faster in spot sign patients (p < 0.001), as well as in patients who experienced HG (p = 0.021), END (p < 0.001), 3-month mortality (p < 0.001), and poor long-term outcome (p < 0.001). The uHG improved the accuracy of baseline ICH volume in the prediction of END (sensitivity 93.1% vs 82.8%, specificity 85.3% vs 82.4%) and 3-month mortality (sensitivity 77.5% vs 70%, specificity 87.9% vs 84.6%). A uHG >10.2 mL/hour emerged as the most powerful predictor of HG (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-9.07, p = 0.008), END (OR 70.22, 95% CI 14.63-337.03, p < 0.001), 3-month mortality (OR 16.96, 95% CI 5.32-54.03, p < 0.001), and poor long-term outcome (OR 6.19, 95% CI 1.32-28.98, p = 0.021).",The uHG represents a powerful and easy-to-use tool for improving the prediction of HG and outcome in patients with acute ICH.,closed_qa
Does eRP correlate of impaired error monitoring in children with ADHD?,"The purpose of the current study was to elaborate on error monitoring in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using the ERP methodology. Children with ADHD executed a visual Go/No-Go task with 25 percent No-Go trials; and a two stimulus reaction time task wherein a neutral warning signal (S1) was presented to inform the child to prepare for an imperative stimulus (S2). In both tasks, children with ADHD responded as fast as controls but made twice as many errors. In addition, they failed to adjust their speed of responding after making an error. Exploring the error-related potentials revealed that the error-related negativity (ERN) was the same for the two groups, but that children with ADHD showed a diminished error positivity (Pe).","Based on these findings, we conclude that children with ADHD are normal in early error monitoring processes related to error detection, but show abnormal response strategy adjustments and are deviant in later error monitoring processes associated with the subjective/emotional, conscious evaluation of the error.",closed_qa
The Quality of Randomized Controlled Trials in Pediatric Orthopaedics: Are We Improving?,"The quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in orthopaedics is a topic of considerable importance, as RCTs play a major role in guiding clinical practice. The quality of RCTs published between 1995 and 2005 has previously been documented. The purpose of the current study was to assess and describe the quality of pediatric orthopaedic RCTs published from 2005 to 2012, by identifying study characteristics associated with higher quality and outlining areas for improvement. A standardized literature search was used to identify pediatric orthopaedic RCTs published in 7 well-recognized journals between September 2005 and July 2012 inclusive. The Detsky Quality Assessment Scale and the CONSORT checklist for Non-Pharmacologic Trials were used to assess the quality of the RCTs. Scores for the Detsky and CONSORT were calculated by 2 independent blinded orthopaedic surgeon reviewers with epidemiologic training. Forty RCTs were included in this analysis. The mean percentage score on the Detsky quality scale was 67%. Sixteen (40%) of the articles satisfied the threshold for a satisfactory level of methodological quality (Detsky>75%). Twenty-five (63%) of these studies were negative studies, concluding no difference between treatment arms. In 52% of the negative studies, an a priori sample size analysis was absent, and 28% were self-described as underpowered. In multiple variable regression analysis, only working with a statistician was significantly associated with higher Detsky percentage scores (P=0.01).","There is a trend for improving quality in pediatric orthopaedic RCTs. Compared with past reports, the mean Detsky score improved from 53% to 67%, and the proportion meeting an acceptable level of quality improved from 19% to 40%. One of the most concerning findings of this study was the lack of attention to sample size and power analysis, and the potential for underpowered studies. Ongoing efforts are necessary to improve the conduct and reporting of clinical trials in pediatric orthopaedics.",closed_qa
Does regular exercise improve weight stability in patients with advanced heart failure?,"The purpose of this study was to determine if a progressive, prescribed home-based aerobic exercise program would alter the natural physiological processes that maintain fluid balance stability in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure after medical optimization (titration of oral medical therapy with or without the infusion of an intravenous inotrope). A total of 56 men and women from a large tertiary trauma I hospital were enrolled with 56 subjects contributing to baseline analysis and 42 subjects at 24 weeks. Subjects were diagnosed with heart failure via NYHA classification IV or III for at least 6 months and were hospitalized for a current acute decompensation exacerbation in which they were being medically optimized. The exercise intervention was a home-based, prescribed, progressive aerobic exercise program lasting for 24 weeks. The exercise participants had weekly phone calls to gather data and progress the exercise program and one 12-week follow up. The usual care participants received random phone calls to collect data and had one 12-week follow up visit to attain physical assessment values. Subjects were primarily female (59%), nonwhite (54%), and NYHA class IV (52%) versus class III (48%). The mean age was 58 years (±11.8 years). The subjects had a mean ejection fraction of 17.7 % (±7%) and mean maximal oxygen consumption of 12.1 (±3.4). Using a hierarchical multiple regression model, it was demonstrated that an exercise prescription (intensity, frequency, duration) significantly predicted 24 h weight fluctuations within a NYHA class III/IV heart failure population after medical optimization (R(2) linear = 0.713, F = 3.224, p = 0.015).",This study demonstrated that exercise is a successful adjunctive therapy to managing the daily weight variability or fluid status instability of patients with NYHA class III/IV heart failure that is often a debilitating aspect of the syndrome.,closed_qa
Is mCP-1 highly expressed in peritoneum following midline laparotomy with peritoneal abrasion in a murine model?,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a CC chemokine, is a potent attractant of monocytes both in vitro and in vivo. However, its role in the repair of peritoneal injury is not well established. This study characterizes MCP-1 expression in surgical wounds following peritoneal abrasion in a murine model. Twenty-five C57 BL6 female mice underwent a 2-cm midline laparotomy with mechanical abrasion of the right peritoneal wall. The mice were sacrificed at various times ranging from 0 to 7 days. Hemotoxylin and eosin stained sections and tissue extracts were made using peritoneal samples from abraded and unabraded areas in each mouse. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed on the specimens to quantitate MCP-1 expression. Values were compared using a t-test. At baseline, there was minimal expression of MCP-1 (<5 pg/mg protein). Following surgery, MCP-1 levels at abraded sites were significantly higher than those at both baseline and unabraded sites at all times up to a week following surgery. Histologic evaluation revealed peritoneal thickening and leukocytic infiltration of only abraded surfaces.",MCP-1 is highly expressed in peritoneum following laparotomy with peritoneal abrasion. Elevations in MCP-1 levels are identified within 6 h of surgery and persist for up to 1 week. The histologic differences between abraded and unabraded areas may be attributable to differences in MCP-1 expression. Further studies using recombinant MCP-1 and anti-MCP-1 antibody may elucidate this relationship.,closed_qa
Is erbB2 expression through heterodimerization with erbB1 necessary for ionizing radiation- but not EGF-induced activation of Akt survival pathway?,"ErbB1-dependent Akt phosphorylation improves post-irradiation cellular survival. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of erbB2 as a heterodimerization partner of erbB1 in activation of Akt survival signaling after irradiation or EGF treatment. Pattern of receptor dimerization and protein phosphorylation were investigated by Western and immunoblotting as well as immunoprecipitation techniques. Residual DNA double-strand breaks (DNA-DSB) and clonogenic activity were analyzed by γH2AX and standard clonogenic assay. To knocked erbB2 expression siRNA was used. In lung carcinoma cell lines A549 and H661, the erbB1-tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor erlotinib blocked EGF as well as ionizing radiation (IR)-induced Akt and DNA-PKcs phosphorylation. Targeting Akt and erbB1 induced cellular radiation sensitivity while, the erbB2-TK inhibitor AG825 neither affected phosphorylation of Akt and DNA-PKcs nor induced radiosensitization. ErbB2-siRNA and the anti-erbB2 antibody trastuzumab blocked IR-induced, but not EGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and impaired the repair of DNA-DSB. Likewise, IR but not EGF enhanced erbB1/erbB2 heterodimerization and resulted in the release of phosphorylated erbB2 cleavage products p135 and p95. Trastuzumab prevented radiation-induced formation of an active erbB1/erbB2 heterodimer and increased cellular radiation sensitivity. ErbB1- but not erbB2-TK inhibition stabilized erbB2 (p185) through preventing its cleavage.",The data indicates that ErbB2 through heterodimerization with erbB1 is necessary for the activation of Akt signaling following irradiation but not following EGF treatment.,closed_qa
Does cDX2 enhance HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cell invasion by altering the expression of matrix metalloproteinases?,"The invasion of trophoblast cells into the maternal uterine decidua is critical for normal placentation, establishment of pregnancy and maintenance of fetal growth in humans. Several growth factors and cytokines have been implicated in trophoblast invasion, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms of invasion are not fully understood. Our earlier studies have found that caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) is hypomethylated in human pre-eclampsia placental tissues. However, whether CDX2 is involved in trophoblast invasion was unclear. In this study, we investigated CDX2 function using a human HTR-8/SVneo cell line that overexpressed CDX2. Cell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX2 enhanced trophoblast cell invasiveness. Meanwhile, MTT assays revealed that CDX2 did not affect cell proliferation. Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the expression level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was significantly increased, whereas the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) was markedly suppressed in the CDX2-overexpressing trophoblast cells. The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is involved in proliferation, migration, metastasis and invasion. Our study showed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling led to decreased expression of CDX2.",We concluded that CDX2 is likely regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during trophoblast cell invasion. Our findings may reveal new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of trophoblast cell invasion and may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of pregnancy-related diseases.,closed_qa
Do mutations for Gaucher disease confer high susceptibility to Parkinson disease?,"Increased frequency of pathogenic variants in GBA, the causative gene for Gaucher disease, has been suggested to be associated with Parkinson disease (PD). To conduct comprehensive resequencing of GBA to identify all sequence variants and to investigate the association of these variants with PD. Case-control study. Multicenter university-based study. Five hundred thirty-four patients with PD, 34 families in which multiple patients with PD are present, and 544 control subjects. Disease status and GBA variations. Comprehensive resequencing of GBA in 534 patients with PD and 544 controls revealed 27 sequence variants: 11 pathogenic variants associated with Gaucher disease, 11 nonsynonymous variants not associated with Gaucher disease, and 5 synonymous variants. Fifty patients with PD (9.4%) had 1 of the 11 pathogenic variants in the heterozygous state, whereas only 2 controls (0.37%) had such variants (odds ratio, 28.0). Among the pathogenic variants, R120W and L444P/RecNciI were highly prevalent, and each showed a significant association with PD. Furthermore, other rare pathogenic variants were found in 13 patients with PD but not in the controls, further confirming the role of these rare variants in the susceptibility to PD. Patients with PD carrying pathogenic variants were significantly younger than those not carrying them. In addition, concordance of PD states and pathogenic variants was observed in 8 multiplex families with PD.","Heterozygous pathogenic variants in GBA confer a high risk for sporadic PD, even for familial clustering, and are associated with significantly earlier age at onset of disease.",closed_qa
Mechanical thrombectomy with the Solitaire stent: is there a learning curve in achieving rapid recanalization times?,"In acute ischemic stroke, good outcome following successful recanalization is time dependent. In patients undergoing endovascular therapy at our institution, recanalization times with the Solitaire stent were retrospectively evaluated to assess for the presence of a learning curve in achieving rapid recanalization. We reviewed patients who presented to our stroke center and achieved successful recanalization with the Solitaire stent exclusively. Time intervals were calculated (CT to angiography arrival, angiography arrival to groin puncture, groin puncture to first deployment, and deployment to recanalization) from time stamped images and angiography records. Patients were divided into three sequential groups, with overall CT to recanalization time and subdivided time intervals compared. 83 patients were treated with the Solitaire stent from May 2009 to February 2012. Recanalization (Thrombolyis in Cerebral Infarction score 2A) occurred in 75 (90.4%) patients. CT to recanalization demonstrated significant improvement over time, which was greatest between the first 25 and the most recent 25 cases (161-94 min; p<0.01). The maximal contribution to this was from improvements in first stent deployment to recanalization time (p=0.001 between the first and third groups), with modest contributions from moving patients from CT to the angiography suite faster (p=0.02 between the first and third groups) and from groin puncture to first stent deployment (p=0.02 between the first and third groups).","There is a learning curve involved in the efficient use of the Solitaire stent in endovascular acute stroke therapy. Along with improvements in patient transfer to angiography and improved efficiency with intracranial access, mastering this device contributed significantly towards reducing recanalization times.",closed_qa
Is arterial stiffness independently associated with emphysema severity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"More patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) die of cardiovascular causes than of respiratory causes, and patients with COPD have increased morbidity and mortality from stroke and coronary heart disease. Arterial stiffness independently predicts cardiovascular risk, is associated with atheromatous plaque burden, and is increased in patients with COPD compared with control subjects matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Elastin fragmentation and changes in collagen are found in the connective tissue of both emphysematous lungs and stiff arteries, but it is not known whether the severity of arterial stiffness in patients with COPD is associated with the severity of emphysema. To identify whether the extent of arterial stiffness is associated with emphysema severity. We performed a cross-sectional study in 157 patients with COPD. We measured pulse wave velocity (a validated measure of arterial stiffness), blood pressure, smoking pack-years, glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein in 157 patients with COPD. We assessed emphysema using quantitative computed tomography scanning in a subgroup of 73 patients. We found that emphysema severity was associated with arterial stiffness (r = 0.471, P < 0.001). The association was independent of smoking, age, sex, FEV(1)% predicted, highly sensitive C-reactive protein and glucose concentrations, cholesterol-high-density lipoprotein ratio, and pulse oximetry oxygen saturations.",Emphysema severity is associated with arterial stiffness in patients with COPD. Similar pathophysiological processes may be involved in both lung and arterial tissue and further studies are now required to identify the mechanism underlying this newly described association.,closed_qa
Does proprioceptive acuity during active knee rotation in the transverse plane vary at different ranges?,"Knee proprioception in the sagittal plane has been widely investigated in prospective studies, however limited information is known about proprioceptive acuity during active knee rotation and the way most commonly injured. To investigate whether proprioceptive acuity during active internal and external knee rotation varies at different ranges in the transverse plane. Healthy volunteers (N: 26) without previous injury or surgery of the knee joint participated in the study.Knee rotation proprioceptive acuity was measured using a custom-designed device. The measure of proprioceptive acuity used in this study was the just-noticeable-difference (JND). Participants actively rotated the knee at different intervals(initial, mid, and terminal internal or external rotation range) to one of four movement blocks and the magnitude of the permitted motion was judged. The means of the JND for proprioceptive acuity at initial internal rotation (0.80° ± 0.06) were significantly (p<0.002) lower than for mid (1.62° ± 0.18), and terminal (2.08° ± 0.35) internal rotation. The means of the JND for proprioceptive acuity at initial external rotation (1.16° ± 0.10) were significantly (p<0.04) lower than for mid (1.95° ± 0.30), and terminal (1.97° ± 0.24) internal rotation.",Participants perceived smaller differences between active internal and external rotation movements at initial rotation range than at the mid and terminal rotation range of movement.

Do supplemental social services improve outcomes in public addiction treatment?,"To evaluate the effectiveness and value of social services added to standard addiction rehabilitation. A controlled, quasi-experimental, field study with repeated measures. Conducted in two groups of publicly supported outpatient addiction treatment programs. Control programs provided standard, twice-weekly, outpatient group counseling. ""Enhanced"" programs provided standard counseling but also case managers to coordinate and expedite use of pre-contracted medical screenings, housing assistance, parenting classes and employment services. The Addiction Severity Index was used to record the nature and severity of patient problems in seven areas at treatment admission and at 6-month follow-up. Services provided during treatment were measured with the Treatment Services Review. Measures were taken on consecutive samples of patients admitted to all programs--before enhancements (wave 1, N = 431)--and at 12 months (wave 2, N = 710); and 26 months following enhancements (wave 3, N = 187). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, treatment services or 6-month outcomes of the two sets of programs in wave 1. Wave 2 and especially wave 3 enhanced programs provided significantly more social and medical services than control programs. Patients treated in enhanced programs showed significantly less substance use, fewer physical and mental health problems and better social function at 6-months than Controls.","Adding social services to public sector programs substantially improved the outcomes of addiction treatment.

Does unphosphorylated calponin enhance the binding force of unphosphorylated myosin to actin?,"Smooth muscle has the distinctive ability to maintain force for long periods of time and at low energy costs. While it is generally agreed that this property, called the latch-state, is due to the dephosphorylation of myosin while attached to actin, dephosphorylated-detached myosin can also attach to actin and may contribute to force maintenance. Thus, we investigated the role of calponin in regulating and enhancing the binding force of unphosphorylated tonic muscle myosin to actin. To measure the effect of calponin on the binding of unphosphorylated myosin to actin, we used the laser trap assay to quantify the average force of unbinding (Funb) in the absence and presence of calponin or phosphorylated calponin. Funb from F-actin alone (0.12±0.01pN; mean±SE) was significantly increased in the presence of calponin (0.20±0.02pN). This enhancement was lost when calponin was phosphorylated (0.12±0.01pN). To further verify that this enhancement of Funb was due to the cross-linking of actin to myosin by calponin, we repeated the measurements at high ionic strength. Indeed, the Funb obtained at a [KCl] of 25mM (0.21±0.02pN; mean±SE) was significantly decreased at a [KCl] of 150mM, (0.13±0.01pN).","This study provides direct molecular level-evidence that calponin enhances the binding force of unphosphorylated myosin to actin by cross-linking them and that this is reversed upon calponin phosphorylation.

Does tegaserod accelerate orocecal transit in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome?,"This study evaluated the effects of a partial 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(4) agonist, tegaserod, on gastric small bowel and colonic transit in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). After a 1 week run-in period, 24 patients with constipation-predominant IBS were randomized to 1 week of tegaserod, 2 mg twice daily, or placebo treatment. Scintigraphic gastric emptying, small bowel transit, and colonic transit were determined before administration of study drug and after 1 week on the medication. Colonic transit was also measured using radiopaque markers and a single radiograph on day 5. Gastric emptying was unaltered by tegaserod. Proximal colonic filling at 6 hours, a measure of orocecal transit, was accelerated by tegaserod (70.4% +/- 1.3% [mean +/- SEM] vs. placebo, 46.4 +/- 1.9; P = 0.015). Proximal colonic emptying half-time and geometric center at 48 hours were also accelerated by tegaserod compared with baseline, but not compared with placebo.

Is transmission of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Mongolia driven by Beijing strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to all first-line drugs?,"Mongolia has high and rising rates of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Spatio-temporal and programmatic evidence suggests a major contribution from MDR-TB transmission, but genotypic evidence has not been assessed. All MDR-TB cases identified during 2012 were examined. Demographic and bacteriological data were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory. Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from culture-confirmed category 1 treatment failures were genotyped using 24-loci mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU-24) analysis. Of the 210 MDR-TB cases identified, 115 (54.8%) were treatment failures (34.8% category 1; 20.0% category 2). Streptomycin resistance was present in 156 (74.3%) cases; including 55/73 (75.3%) category 1 treatment failures who had never been exposed to streptomycin. Among category 1 treatment failures, Beijing lineage strains predominated (88.0%; 59/67 of genotyped isolates). MIRU-24 clustering was documented in 62.7% (42/67) of strains; 55.2% (37/67) remained clustered when drug susceptibility test results were considered. In total 59.5% (25/42) of clustered strains were Beijing lineage and demonstrated in-vitro resistance to all first-line drugs tested.",The MDR-TB epidemic in Mongolia appears to be driven by primary transmission of Beijing lineage strains resistant to all first-line drugs.

Compared to existing meta-analysis, new RCTs were evaluated and subgroup analyses of different anastomotic techniques were carried out. We conducted a bibliographic research using the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database from January 1990 to July 2015 of RCTs. Only RCTs, in English, that compared PG versus all types of PJ were selected. Data were independently extracted by two authors. We performed a quantitative systematic review following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. A random-effect model was applied. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I (2) and χ (2) tests. Primary outcomes were rate of overall and clinically significant pancreatic fistula (POPF). Ten RCTs were identified including 1629 patients, 826 undergoing PG and 803 undergoing PJ. RCTs showed significant heterogeneity regarding definitions of POPF, perioperative management, and characteristics of pancreatic gland. No significant differences were found in the rate of overall and clinically significant POPF, morbidity, mortality, reoperation, and intra-abdominal sepsis when PG was compared with all types PJ or when subgroup analysis (double-layer PG with or without anterior gastrotomy versus duct to mucosa PJ and single-layer PG versus single-layer end-to-end/end-to-side PJ) were analyzed.","PG is not superior to PJ in the prevention of POPF.

Does endogenous elevation of plasma cholecystokinin prevent gallstones?,"Regular gall bladder contraction reduces bile stasis and prevents gallstone formation. Intraduodenal administration of exogenous pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor-I (PSTI-I, also known as monitor peptide) causes cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion. We proposed that stimulation of CCK release by PSTI would produce gall bladder contraction and prevent gallstones in mice fed a lithogenic diet. Therefore, we tested the effect of overexpression of rat PSTI-I in pancreatic acinar cells on plasma CCK levels and gall bladder function in a transgenic mouse line (TgN[Psti1]; known hereafter as PSTI-I tg). Importantly, PSTI tg mice had elevated fasting and fed plasma CCK levels compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Only mice fed the lithogenic diet developed gallstones. Both fasting and stimulated plasma CCK levels were substantially reduced in both WT and PSTI-I tg mice on the lithogenic diet. Moreover, despite higher CCK levels PSTI-I tg animals developed more gallstones than WT animals.","Together with the previously observed decrease in CCK-stimulated gall bladder emptying in mice fed a lithogenic diet, our findings suggest that a lithogenic diet causes gallstone formation by impaired CCK secretion in addition to reduced gall bladder sensitivity to CCK.",closed_qa
Does body mass index predict aldosterone production in normotensive adults on a high-salt diet?,"The mechanisms underlying obesity-mediated cardiovascular disease are not fully understood. Aldosterone and insulin resistance both are associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease. The objectives of this study were to test the hypotheses that aldosterone production is elevated and associated with insulin resistance in overweight adults on a high-sodium diet. Healthy normotensive adults were categorized as lean body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m(2) (n = 63) or overweight BMI 25 kg/m(2) or greater (n = 57). After 7 d of a high-sodium diet, participants fasted overnight and remained supine throughout hemodynamic and laboratory assessments and angiotensin II (AngII) stimulation. The overweight group, compared with the lean group, had higher 24-h urinary aldosterone (9.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.6 +/- 0.5 microg per 24 h; P = 0.003) and higher AngII-stimulated serum aldosterone (11.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.6 ng/dl; P = 0.04). There were no differences in 24-h urinary cortisol or sodium or supine measurements of plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone, or serum potassium. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was predicted by urinary aldosterone excretion (r = 0.32, P = 0.03) and serum aldosterone response to AngII stimulation (r = 0.28, P = 0.02) independent of age and BMI.","Urinary aldosterone excretion and AngII-stimulated aldosterone are increased in overweight, compared with lean, normotensive adults. The correlation of these measures of aldosterone production with insulin resistance suggests a potential role for aldosterone in the pathophysiology of obesity-mediated insulin resistance.",closed_qa
"""Can't you initiate me here?","Despite dramatic improvement in antiretroviral therapy (ART) access globally, people living with HIV who inject drugs continue to face barriers that limit their access to treatment. This paper explores barriers and facilitators to ART initiation among clients attending a methadone clinic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We interviewed 12 providers and 20 clients living with HIV at the Muhimbili National Hospital methadone clinic between January and February 2015. We purposively sampled clients based on sex and ART status and providers based on job function. To analyze interview transcripts, we adopted a content analysis approach. Participants identified several factors that hindered timely ART initiation for clients at the methadone clinic. These included delays in CD4 testing and receiving CD4 test results; off-site HIV clinics; stigma operating at the individual, social and institutional levels; insufficient knowledge of the benefits of early ART initiation among clients; treatment breakdown at the clinic level possibly due to limited staff; and initiating ART only once one feels physically ill. Participants perceived social support as a buffer against stigma and facilitator of HIV treatment. Some clients also reported that persistent monitoring and follow-up on their HIV care and treatment by methadone clinic providers led them to initiate ART.","Health system factors, stigma and limited social support pose challenges for methadone clients living with HIV to initiate ART. Our findings suggest that on-site point-of-care CD4 testing, a peer support system, and trained HIV treatment specialists who are able to counsel HIV-positive clients and initiate them on ART at the methadone clinic could help reduce barriers to timely ART initiation for methadone clients.",closed_qa
Does ethnicity affect IGFBP-3 and IGF-II in normal healthy young adult subjects?,"While the effects of age on the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis are well documented, the influence of ethnic background is unknown. The differences in IGF and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) were investigated in two ethnic groups. A cross-sectional study of an age-selected cohort of healthy, normoglycaemic, non-obese Caucasian (C) and Asian (A) subjects. Fifty-three (27 C, 26 A) subjects with a mean age (+/- SD) of 20.6 +/- 0.8 years were studied. Fasting measurements of glucose, insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3. Western ligand blotting and immunoblotting with IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 of serum samples. There were no significant differences in IGF-I levels between Caucasian and Asian subjects (C 218 +/- 55 vs A 229 +/- 40 micrograms/l; P = 0.44). IGF-II (C 707 +/- 110 vs A 583 +/- 75 micrograms/l; P < 0.0001) and IGFBP-3 (C 5.9 +/- 1.2 vs A 5.12 +/- 1.17 mg/l; P = 0.01) levels were significantly higher in Caucasian subjects. Immunoblotting of ligand blots revealed no protease activity on either IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-2 to account for these ethnic differences.",Ethnic differences in IGFBP-3 and associated IGF-II levels may affect the inter-relationships of IGFs and their binding proteins and need to be considered when interpreting IGF data on growth and metabolism.,closed_qa
Does [ Prosthetic treatment need among the elder in Germany ]?,"The life expectancy has significantly increased in the last 100 years. Therefore it has to be taken into account that many patients who come to the dentist are over 60. In this group of patients, you should pay attention to geriatric aspects of medical history and treatment plan. Nowadays as well as in the past, teeth loss correlates with the age especially thus with the branch of dentistry which is prosthetics. The aim of this study was to define: 1) the condition of the masticatory system of people over 60 who live with their families or at the nursing home; 2) the assessment of prosthetics needs of these groups; 3) differences (if occure) in these examined groups; 4) coexistence of general diseases. The study was conducted on the group of 100 elder people in the range of age between 61-95. First group constituted 50 patients from nursing home in Hannover next 50 patients were treated in private dental practice in Lohne. The study included medical history and the dental examination. The dental examination focused on the inspection of the face symmetry, condition of TMJ, teeth, mucosa and the type of dental appliences as well as the level of oral hygiene. The proper condition of masticatory system was classified in 58% of patients from nursing home and 62% of patients from private practice. Only in 60% of patients from both of group the proper shape of the temporo-mandibular joint was determinated. Patients who suffered from general diseases constituted 72% of those living in nursing home and 66% those from private practice. Among these patients, the circulatory system problems were the most frequent and the diabetes occure almost equally often. 42% of patients from nursing home determinated need to weave dentures or other dental appliences in comparison to 32% from private practice.",The condition of the masticatory system was inefficient in both groups but the dental needs of patients from nursing home were significantly higher.,closed_qa
Is a genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 associated with susceptibility to biliary tract cancer?,"Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) is clinically important for the metabolism of many therapeutic drugs. CYP2C19 has two main point mutation sites leading to low metabolic capacity. Several CYP enzymes are also important for the metabolism of chemical carcinogens, and several studies have reported associations between CYP polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. Speculating on a potential association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility, we conducted this study in two phases. Cell lines of various gastroenterological cancers were screened in the first phase. A clinical investigation was then conducted to confirm the association with the candidate cancer in the second phase. Genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 was investigated in a total of 114 cell lines of five gastroenterological cancers. Based on this screening investigation suggesting an association with biliary tract cancer, we conducted a related study by recruiting 65 patients with biliary tract cancer and 566 patients with benign diseases as controls. Among the 114 cell lines investigated, biliary tract cancer was suggested to be most strongly associated with poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. Among 65 patients with biliary tract cancer, 18 (28%) were poor metabolizers of CYP2C19, whereas 87 (15%) of 566 control patients were poor metabolizers. The age- and gender-adjusted odds ratios for intermediate and poor metabolizers regarding the risk of biliary tract cancer were 1.5 (95% CI: 0.8-3.0, P = 0.17) and 2.7 (1.3-5.9, P = 0.006) compared to extensive metabolizers.",A genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 is associated with susceptibility to biliary tract cancer.,closed_qa
Does concomitant inactivation of foxo3a and fancc or fancd2 reveal a two-tier protection from oxidative stress-induced hydrocephalus?,"This study seeks at investigating the cause of hydrocephalus, and at identifying therapeutic targets for the prevention of hydrocephalus. In this study, we show that inactivation of the Foxo3a gene in two mouse models of Fanconi anemia (FA) leads to the development of hydrocephalus in late embryonic stage and after birth. More than 50% of Foxo3a(-/-) Fancc(-/-) or Foxo3a(-/-) Fancd2(-/-) mice die during embryonic development or within 6 months of life as a result of hydrocephalus characterized by cranial distortion, dilation of the ventricular system, reduced thickness of the cerebral cortex, and disorganization of the ependymal cilia and subcommissural organ. Combined deficiency of Foxo3a and Fancc or Fancd2 not only impairs the self-renewal capacity but also markedly increases the apoptosis of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs), leading to defective neurogenesis. Increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently de-regulated mitosis and ultimately apoptosis in the neural stem or progenitor cells is identified as one of the potential mechanisms of congenital obstructive hydrocephalus. The work unravels a two-tier protective mechanism for preventing oxidative stress-induced hydrocephalus.","The deletion of Foxo3a in FA mice increased the accumulation of ROS and subsequently de-regulated mitosis and ultimately apoptosis in the NSPCs, leading to hydrocephalus development.",closed_qa
Is the number of antral follicles in normal women with proven fertility the best reflection of reproductive age?,"The purpose of this study was to compare the predictive capacity of several markers of reproductive age in normal women. Healthy female volunteers (n = 162) aged 25-46 years with proven, normal fertility and regular menstrual cycles were recruited. In this selected group, chronological age was assumed to approximate reproductive age and, therefore, was taken as the proxy-variable for reproductive age. The number of antral follicles with 2-10 mm diameter, total ovarian volume, total follicular volume, mean follicular volume, and volume of either the smallest or largest ovary were estimated by transvaginal sonography of the ovaries. Serum levels of early follicular FSH, estradiol and inhibin B, as well as the response of estradiol and inhibin B to exogenous GnRH agonist administration (GAST), were also evaluated. Regression analysis revealed that the antral follicle number showed the highest correlation with age (r = -0.68, P = 0.001), and explained 46% of its variance. All other variables, except inhibin B, were moderately correlated with age. Responses of estradiol and inhibin B to the GnRH agonist were moderately correlated with age, but highly correlated with the number of antral follicles.","It is concluded that the number of antral follicles has the closest association with chronological age in normal women with proven fertility. As stimulated estradiol and inhibin B clearly reflect the size of the antral follicle cohort, the GAST may be considered the second best single test to predict reproductive age.",closed_qa
Are routine preoperative laboratory analyses unnecessary before elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,"We formulated a clinical pathway (CP) for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), which included the following preoperative evaluation: history and physical (H&P), right upper quadrant ultrasound (US), and liver function tests (LFTs). We hypothesized that routine LFTs did not alter management beyond that dictated by H&P and US, and could be excluded from the CP. The study involved 387 consecutive patients undergoing elective LC. Abnormalities in the preoperative evaluation were compared with the finding of choledocholithiasis or other unexpected outcomes. In 187 (48%) patients, abnormalities were found by H&P (n = 7), US (n = 13), and LFTs (n = 177). Seven patients (2%) had documented choledocholithiasis; two had abnormal H & P; three had abnormal US; and four had abnormal LFTs. No patient with choledocholithiasis had abnormal LFTs but normal H&P and US.","Routine LFTs before elective LC are not cost effective. Before LC H&P and US are warranted, but LFTs do not add any useful information and should not be routinely measured.",closed_qa
Is adherence to Healthy Eating Index-2010 inversely associated with metabolic syndrome and its features among Iranian adult women?,"Nowadays, metabolic syndrome (MetS) is deemed as a major public health challenge in both developed and developing countries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association between Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) score and MetS and its features among Iranian female nurses. This cross-sectional study was performed among 1036 Iranian women. A validated, self-administered, dish-based, semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the habitual intake of participants. HEI-2010 score was used to assess diet quality of participants. MetS was defined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders was used to assess the relation between HEI-2010 and MetS. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the highest quartile of HEI-2010 had the lowest risk of MetS compared with those in the first quartile (odds ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.96). Furthermore, the risk of MetS features including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high serum triacylglycerol and low serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol significantly decreased across HEI-2010 quartiles (P<0.05).","Higher HEI-2010 scores were inversely associated with lower risk of MetS and its components among Iranian women.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 28 September 2016; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2016.173.",closed_qa
Do prostate cancer detection on urinalysis for alpha methylacyl coenzyme a racemase protein?,"We assessed the feasibility of a novel urinary test for prostate cancer based on the presence of alpha methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) protein in voided urine specimens obtained after prostate biopsy. Clean catch voided urine specimens were prospectively collected from 26 consecutive men immediately after transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy for suspected malignancy. The presence of AMACR was evaluated in a blinded manner by Western blot analysis and correlated with biopsy results and patient clinical information. AMACR was detected in the urine in 18 of 26 patients (69%). AMACR was detected in all 12 patients with biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (100% sensitivity, 95% CI 75 to 100), in 5 of 12 with no evidence of cancer on biopsy (58% specificity, 95% CI 29 to 78) and in 1 of 2 (50%, 95% CI 3 to 80) with atypia on biopsy. Overall AMACR detection was associated with cancer status by prostate biopsy in 21 of 26 patients (86%).","We report the feasibility of a novel, noninvasive, nonprostate specific antigen based molecular approach to detect prostate cancer in voided urine. To our knowledge this is the first report of AMACR protein detection in the urine of patients with prostate cancer. A screening test based on urinary AMACR may develop into a useful adjunct to serum prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination for identifying men at increased risk for harboring prostate cancer despite negative biopsy. Such a test has potential application for stratifying patients into low and high risk groups for surveillance vs repeat biopsy.",closed_qa
Are chorionic gonadotropin beta-gene variants associated with recurrent miscarriage in two European populations?,"The incidence of recurrent miscarriage (RM) (>or=3 consecutive pregnancy losses) is estimated as 1-2% in fertile couples. Familial clustering of RM has suggested the contribution of a genetic component. A low level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in maternal serum during the first trimester of the pregnancy is a clinically accepted risk factor for miscarriage. We sought to study whether variation in chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit genes (CGBs) expressed in placenta may contribute to the risk of RM. Resequencing of CGB5 and CGB8, the two most actively transcribed loci of the four HCG beta-duplicate genes, was performed. A case-control study involving two sample sets, from Estonia (n = 194) and Finland (n = 185), was performed. RM patients (n = 184) and fertile controls (n = 195) participated in the study. From 71 identified variants in CGB5 and CGB8, 48 polymorphisms were novel. Significant protective effect was associated with two single nucleotide polymorphisms located at identical positions in intron 2 in both CGB5 [P = 0.007; odds ratio (OR) = 0.53] and CGB8 (P = 0.042; OR = 0.15), and with four CGB5 promoter variants (P < 0.03; OR = 0.54-0.58). The carriers of minor alleles had a reduced risk of RM. The haplotype structure of the CGB8 promoter was consistent with balancing selection; a rare mutation in CGB8 initiator element was detected only among patients (n = 3). In addition, three rare nonsynonymous substitutions were identified among RM cases as possible variants increasing the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss.",The findings encourage studying the functional effect of the identified variants on CGB expression and HCG hormone activity to elucidate further the role of CGB variation in RM.,closed_qa
Is endothelial function in newborn infants related to folate levels and birth weight?,"Low maternal folate levels during pregnancy correlate with low birth weight, a perinatal risk factor for later cardiovascular disease. We studied relationships between red blood cell folate levels, birth weight, and vascular endothelial function (a key factor in the early pathophysiologic processes of heart disease) in newborn infants. We included 82 infants (30 low birth weight) and their mothers. A laser Doppler technique was used to measure skin perfusion during transdermal iontophoresis of acetylcholine (an endothelium-dependent vasodilator). Red blood cell folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels were determined. The perfusion response to acetylcholine was lower in low birth weight infants than in normal birth weight control subjects (mean: 35 vs 76 perfusion units). The neonatal acetylcholine response correlated with red blood cell folate levels in both infants and their mothers. The folate levels of low birth weight and control infants did not differ significantly (mean: 1603 vs 1795 nmol/L), but mothers of low birth weight infants had lower folate levels than did mothers of control infants (mean: 805 vs 1109 nmol/L). In multivariate analysis, low birth weight and red blood cell folate levels contributed independently to endothelial function in newborn infants. The levels of vitamin B12 and homocysteine were similar in the 2 groups and did not correlate with endothelial function.",The data presented here provide the first evidence for a relationship between folate levels and vascular endothelial function in newborn infants.,closed_qa
Does sildenafil influence hepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with cirrhosis?,"To investigate if sildenafil increases splanchnic blood flow and changes the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in patients with cirrhosis. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors are valuable in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension in patients with end-stage liver disease. However, the effect of phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors on splanchnic blood flow and portal hypertension remains essentially unknown. Ten patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis (five females/five males, mean age 54 +/- 8 years) and an HVPG above 12 mmHg were studied after informed consent. Measurement of splanchnic blood flow and the HVPG during liver vein catheterization were done before and 80 min after oral administration of 50 mg sildenafil. Blood flow was estimated by use of indocyanine green clearance technique and Fick's principle, with correction for non-steady state. The plasma concentration of sildenafil was 222 +/- 136 ng/mL 80 min after administration. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 77 +/- 7 mmHg to 66 +/- 12 mmHg, P = 0.003, while the splanchnic blood flow and oxygen consumption remained unchanged at 1.14 +/- 0.71 L/min and 2.3 +/- 0.6 mmol/min, respectively. Also the HVPG remained unchanged (18 +/- 2 mmHg vs 16 +/- 2 mmHg) with individual changes ranging from -8 mmHg to +2 mmHg. In seven patients, HVPG decreased and in three it increased.","In spite of arterial blood pressure decreases 80 min after administration of the phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor sildenafil, the present study could not demonstrate any clinical relevant influence on splanichnic blood flow, oxygen consumption or the HVPG.",closed_qa
Is the entire vasoactive intestinal polypeptide molecule required for the activation of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor : functional and binding studies on opossum internal anal sphincter smooth muscle?,"Because no significant information exists regarding the structure-activity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) to gut smooth muscle, we performed functional studies in vitro on opossum internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle strips and supplemented them with binding studies to assess the ability of VIP, its fragments and analogs to inhibit [125I]VIP binding to IAS smooth muscle membranes. Binding of radiolabeled VIP to its receptor was specific, saturable and time- and temperature-dependent. Of all the substances tested, VIP was the most potent in causing a fall in the resting tension of the IAS and inhibiting [125I]VIP binding. VIP 2-28, VIP 10-28 and the putative VIP antagonists (1 x 10(-6) M) [4Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP (VIP analog) and (N-Ac-Tyr1, D-Phe2)-growth hormone-releasing factor [GRF] (1-29)-NH2 (GRF analog) caused significant inhibition of [125I]VIP binding, but had only minimal effect on the resting tension of the IAS. VIP 9-18 and VIP 1-12 had neither any significant effect nor inhibition of receptor binding. The rank order of potencies for inhibition of binding was VIP > VIP analog > VIP 10-28 = VIP 2-28 > GRF analog > peptide histidine isoleucine > VIP 9-18. The IC50 values for VIP, VIP analog, VIP 10-28, VIP 2-28, GRF analog and peptide histidine isoleucine were 9.6 x 10(-9), 1.6 x 10(-7), 5.5 x 10(-7), 6.2 x 10(-7), 1.2 x 10(-6) and 1.2 x 10(-5) M, respectively.",the full action of VIP is critically dependent upon the integrity of the entire VIP molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),closed_qa
"Is thyroxine transfer from cerebrospinal fluid into choroid plexus and brain affected by brefeldin A , low sodium , BCH , and phloretin , in ventriculo-cisternal perfused rabbits?","Thyroxine (T4) hormone is synthesized by the thyroid gland and then released into the systemic circulation where it binds to a number of proteins. Dysfunction in T4 transport mechanisms has been demonstrated in multiple central nervous system (CNS) diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In the presence of different compounds that inhibit potential T4 transport mechanisms, this study investigated the transfer of T4 from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into Choroid Plexus (CP) and other brain tissues. The compounds used were brefeldin A, low sodium artificial CSF (aCSF), BCH, phloretin, and taurocholate (TA). Radiolabeled T4 ((125)I-T4) was perfused continuously into the CSF and was assessed in several brain compartments with reference molecule (14)C-mannitol and blue dextran, using the in vivo ventriculo-cisternal perfusion (V-C) technique in the rabbit. The aCSF containing the drug of interest was infused after 1 h of perfusion. Drugs were applied independently to the aCSF after 1 h of control perfusion. Of interest, in presence of low sodium or BCH, the percentage recovery of (125)I-T4, was increased compared to controls, with concomitant increase in T4 clearance. Conversely, brefeldin A, phloretin, and TA did not exert any significant effect on the recovery and clearance of (125)I-T4 assessed in aCSF. On the other hand, the uptake of (125)I-T4 into CP was raised by 18 fold compared to controls in the presence of brefeldin A. In addition, low sodium, BCH, or phloretin alone, enhanced the uptake of (125)I-T4 by almost 3-fold, whereas TA did not show any significant effect. Finally, the uptake and distribution of (125)I-T4 into other brain regions including ependymal region (ER) and caudate putamen (CAP) were significantly higher than in controls.","Our study suggests the involvement of different mechanisms for the transfer of (125)I-T4 from CSF into CP and other brain regions.

Do a qualitative study exploring medicines use pattern and practice among general public in Malaysia?,"The objective of this study is to explore the pattern and practice of medicine use among the general public; and to explore the key factors influencing medicine use among medicine users. A qualitative approach using focus group discussions was conducted to get in-depth information about medicines use pattern and practice from the general public. Adult people who reported using medicines at the time of study or in the previous month were approached. Two focus group discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The obtained data were analysed using thematic content analysis. This study found that there are some misunderstanding about the appropriate use of medicines. The majority of the participants reported that they were complying with their medication regimen. However, forgetting to take medicines was stated by 4 participants while 2 participants stopped taking medicines when they felt better. In addition, 10 participants reporting using medicines according to their own knowledge and past experience.

Does radiofrequency catheter ablation of pulmonary vein roots result in axonal degeneration of distal epicardial nerves?,"In treatment of atrial fibrillations (AF), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at the pulmonary vein (PV) roots isolates AF triggers in the myocardial sleeves, but also can destroy PV ganglia and branches of the intrinsic cardiac nerve plexus. To determine the long-term impact of RFA at the PV roots on the structure of epicardial nerves located distally from the RFA site. Five black-faced sheep underwent epicardial RFA of the left and middle PV roots. Two to 3 months after RFA, we obtained samples of epicardial nerves from remote locations of the left dorsal (LD) neural subplexus that extends along the roots of the superior PVs toward the coronary sinus (CS) and dorsal left ventricle (LV). Right atrial epicardial nerves from the right ventral (RV) neural subplexus of the ablated animals and epicardial nerves from LD neural subplexus of five additional intact sheep were used as control. Nerve morphology was examined using histochemical, immunohistochemical and transmission electron microscopy. Histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining did not reveal any epicardial nerve alterations. However, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) staining showed clearly the reduced numbers of TH and ChAT immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibers within epicardial nerves derived from the remote LD subplexus; control samples from all examined animals were full of evenly distributed TH-IR and ChAT-IR nerve fibers. In sharp contrast to control nerves, numerous swollen or disintegrated axons and Schwann cells with pyknotic nuclei inside unmyelinated and myelinated nerve fibers were identified by electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of epicardial nerves from the CS and LV regions in all ablated animals.","Degeneration of remote atrial and ventricular epicardial nerves is evident 2-3 months after epicardial RFA at the PV roots. Such nerves are likely to be non-functional. Therefore, long-term autonomic dysfunction is a potential risk of PV isolation by RFA.",closed_qa
Does lowering homocysteine decrease levels and expression of VEGF ( 165 ) and endostatin?,"Homocysteine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endostatin have been implicated in angiogenesis and in the development and progression of atherothrombotic vascular disease. We sought to determine whether homocysteine modulates plasma levels of VEGF and endostatin and their expression in leukocytes in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or diabetes mellitus (DM). Ten patients with PAD and 15 patients with type 2 DM were evaluated before and 6 wk after oral administration of folic acid and B vitamins. Evaluation included measurements of plasma levels of homocysteine, VEGF, and endostatin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the expression of VEGF and endostatin mRNAs in leukocytes using RT-PCR. The measurements were compared with baseline findings in 12 healthy subjects. Basal homocysteine (P < 0.001) and VEGF (P < 0.01) levels were elevated in all patients versus healthy subjects. Basal endostatin levels were lower in patients with PAD but were higher in patients with DM compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.001). In patients with PAD or DM, folic acid and B vitamins administration resulted in significant reduction (P < 0.001) of plasma levels of homocysteine (20.9% and 26.2%), VEGF (29.7% and 40.4%) and endostatin (9.4% and 5.7%), respectively. Moreover, VEGF and endostatin mRNA expression in leukocytes was down-regulated in all patients after B vitamins and folate treatment.",These findings demonstrate that lowering of homocysteine with B vitamins and folic acid resulted in substantial reduction of plasma levels of VEGF but minimal reduction of endostatin and in down-regulation of their expression in leukocytes in patients with PAD or DM.,closed_qa
Do methamphetamine dependent individuals show attenuated brain response to pleasant interoceptive stimuli?,"Mechano-receptive C-fiber (MR-CF) stimulation via slow stroking of C-fiber rich skin areas can be used to probe the relationship between reward and interoception. Individuals with substance use disorders show impaired reward processing, and dysfunctional interoceptive processing of MR-CF may contribute to this dysfunction. This study predicted that methamphetamine dependent (MD) individuals would exhibit altered responses to MR-CF stimulation in brain regions important for interoception. Recently abstinent MD (n=25) and comparison (CTL, n=17) subjects received a pleasant interoceptive stimulus (""Soft Touch"" consisting of a slow brush stroke) to the palm or forearm during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were provided with cues signaling stimulation to examine anticipatory and stimulus-related processing. Subjective responses were measured using visual analog scales (VAS). Groups were similar on behavioral performance and ratings of the interoceptive stimuli, yet MD exhibited lower anterior insula, dorsal striatum, and thalamus activation than CTL, across anticipation and soft touch conditions. The lower the anterior insula activation, the faster the reaction time across conditions in MD, whereas the opposite pattern was evident in CTL. Striatal activation in MD was greater than CTL during anticipation, but lower during soft touch. Greater striatal attenuation was associated with higher VAS pleasantness ratings of soft touch.","MD expend fewer brain processing resources during soft touch, a form of positively-valenced interoceptive stimuli, in brain areas that are important for both interoception and reward. Future studies will ascertain if sustained abstinence from methamphetamine use can normalize aberrant neural interoceptive processing.",closed_qa
Is the amyloidogenicity of gelsolin controlled by proteolysis and pH?,"Normally, gelsolin functions in plasma as part of the actin-scavenging system to assemble and disassemble actin filaments. The Asp 187-->Asn (D187N) Asp 187-->Tyr (D187Y) gelsolin mutations facilitate two proteolytic cuts in the parent protein generating a 71-residue fragment that forms amyloid fibrils in humans, putatively causing Finnish type familial amyloidosis (FAF). We investigated the role of the D187N mutation in amyloidogenicity using biophysical studies in vitro. Both the recombinant wild-type and D187N FAF-associated gelsolin fragments adopt an ensemble of largely unfolded structures that do not self-associate into amyloid at pH 7. 5. Incubation of either fragment at low pHs (6.0-4.0) leads to the formation of well-defined fibrils within 72 hours, however.","The D187N mutation has been suggested to destabilize the structure of the gelsolin parent protein (specifically domain 2), facilitating two proteolytic cleavage events. Our studies demonstrate that generating the largely unstructured peptide is not sufficient alone for amyloid formation in vitro (on a time scale of months). A drop in pH or an analogous environmental change appears necessary to convert the unstructured fragment into amyloid fibrils, probably through an associative mechanism. The wild-type gelsolin fragment will make amyloid fibrils from pH 6 to 4 in vitro, but neither the wild-type fragment nor fibrils have been observed in vivo. It is possible that domain 2 of wild-type gelsolin is stable in the context of the whole protein and not susceptible to the proteolytic degradation that affords the 71-residue FAF-associated peptide.",closed_qa
Do gender-based disparities in authorship also exist in cancer palliative care?,"Women physicians in the United States publish less than men and advance academically at a slower pace. Do such gender-based disparities also occur in cancer palliative care, a field in which women appear to hold a strong interest? We undertook a detailed survey of the cancer palliative care literature. We selected 5 cancer palliative care journals on the basis of their high impact factors, and we assessed authorship for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. We determined gender and highest educational degree for all US first and last authors. A total of 794 authors are the focus of this report. In 2005, 50% of first authors were women, but only 14% were women physicians. Similarly, 39% of senior authors were women during this year, but only 8% were women physicians. Over this 15-year period, no statistically significant trends were detected to indicate an increase in the number of women authors.","These findings are sobering. Future efforts might focus on strategies to improve rates of authorship and, ultimately, improve rates of academic promotion for women interested in cancer palliative care.",closed_qa
Does bosentan improve exercise tolerance and Tei index in patients with pulmonary hypertension and prostanoid therapy?,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease with a bad prognosis. Prostanoids are well established in the medical treatment of this disease. Treatment of patients with progressive disease despite prostanoids remains a therapeutic challenge. In this study, we examined the effect of adding bosentan, an endothelin antagonist, to existing prostanoid therapy on exercise capacity (6-min walking distance [6MWD]) and right ventricular (RV) function (Tei index) in patients with progressive pulmonary hypertension. Prospective, nonrandomized, open-label study. University hospital. Sixteen patients with pulmonary hypertension (PAH, n = 10; pulmonary hypertension due to other cause, n = 6) with progressive disease receiving either beraprost (n = 3), inhaled iloprost (n = 10), or iloprost IV (n = 3). Combination therapy with bosentan (final dosage, 125 mg bid) was initiated following an interval of 3-months minimum of unchanged prostanoid therapy. Tei index, 6MWD, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class were assessed prior to the initiation of combination therapy (baseline), at 6 months after initiation of combination therapy, and every 3 months thereafter. Two patients were followed up for 6 months only; all remaining patients reached a mean follow-up period (+/- SD) of 13.5 +/- 5.0 months (range, 9 to 22 months). 6MWD increased by 42.5 +/- 66 m at 6 months and 44.6 +/- 66 m at the last follow-up (both time points vs baseline, p < 0.001), and Tei index improved by -0.13 +/- 0.08 at 6 months and - 0.13 +/- 0.11 at the last follow-up (both time points vs baseline, p < 0.001). All patients reported subjective improvements. Nine of 16 patients exhibited improvement in NYHA functional class at 6 months. No side effects occurred that required dose adjustment or discontinuation of the study medication.",Bosentan administered to patients with progressive pulmonary hypertension receiving prostanoids resulted in an increased exercise capacity and an improved RV function. Bosentan therefore appears to be well suited for combination therapy with prostanoids in selected patients pending results of ongoing randomized trials.,closed_qa
Does reperfusion lung injury after cold preservation correlate with decreased levels of intrapulmonary high-energy phosphates?,"To evaluate the role of energy state in primary graft dysfunction, which is crucial in lung transplantation, we investigated the relationship between intrapulmonary high-energy phosphate compounds and reperfusion lung injury after cold preservation. Using an isolated rat lung perfusion model with fresh rat blood as perfusate, rat lungs were exposed to various cold preservation periods (0, 6, 9, and 12 hr) and reperfused. We found that extending the preservation period exacerbated the pulmonary hemodynamics after reperfusion. The levels of intrapulmonary high-energy phosphate compounds did not change during cold preservation, but these levels after reperfusion decreased as the preservation period was prolonged. The pulmonary hemodynamics after reperfusion were inversely correlated with the intrapulmonary high-energy phosphate compound levels after reperfusion. Total adenine nucleotide and ATP were sensitive indicators of reperfusion lung injury after cold preservation. Energy charge was not a sensitive indicator. The decreased levels of intrapulmonary high-energy phosphate compounds after reperfusion following cold preservation period were partially caused by their decreased production.","These results demonstrated that reperfusion lung injury after cold preservation was closely correlated with decreased levels of intrapulmonary high-energy phosphate compounds after reperfusion, although the levels of the intrapulmonary high-energy phosphate compounds did not change during cold preservation of up to 12 hr.",closed_qa
Does the Surgical Treatment of Severe Endometriosis Positively affect the Chance of Natural or Assisted Pregnancy Postoperatively?,"To report reproductive outcomes following laparoscopic surgical excision of histologically confirmed r-ASRM stage III-IV endometriosis. A retrospective cohort study was performed at the Royal Hospital for Women, a university teaching hospital, Sydney, Australia. Women who had fertility-preserving laparoscopic excision of stage III-IV endometriosis from 1997 to 2009 were contacted regarding reproductive outcomes. In the study period, 355 women underwent surgery for stage III-IV endometriosis. Follow-up data are available for 253/355 (71%) women. Postoperatively, 142/253 (56%) women attempted to conceive with a conception rate of 104/142 (73%). Confidence intervals for pregnancy for women who were attempting conception (including the nonresponders) range from 104/262 (40%) to 224/262 (85%). Median time to conception was 12 months. No positive prognostic factors for pregnancy were identified on regression analyses.","These data provide information to women with suspected severe disease preoperatively concerning their likely postoperative fertility outcomes. Ours is a population with severe endometriosis, rather than an infertile population with endometriosis, so caution needs to be applied when applying these data to women with fertility issues alone.",closed_qa
Does combinational Therapy enhance the Effects of Anti-IGF-1R mAb Figitumumab to Target Small Cell Lung Cancer?,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant malignancy with distinct biologic properties. Antibody targeting therapy has been actively investigated as a new drug modality. We tested the expression of IGF-1R and calculated the survival in 61 SCLC patients. We also evaluated the anti-tumor effects of anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody Figitumumab (CP) on SCLC, and tried two drug combinations to improve CP therapy. Our clinical data suggested that high IGF-1R expression was correlated with low SCLC patient survival. We then demonstrated the effect of CP was likely through IGF-1R blockage and down-regulation without IGF-1R auto-phosphorylation and PI3K/AKT activation. However, we observed elevated MEK/ERK activation upon CP treatment in SCLC cells, and this MEK/ERK activation was enhanced by ß-arrestin1 knockdown while attenuated by ß-arrestin2 knockdown. We found both MEK/ERK inhibitor and metformin could enhance CP treatment in SCLC cells. We further illustrated the additive effect of metformin was likely through promoting further IGF-1R down-regulation.","Our results highlighted the potential of anti-IGF-1R therapy and the adjuvant therapy strategy with either MEK/ERK inhibitor or metformin to target SCLC, warranting further studies.",closed_qa
Does higher Childhood Red Meat Intake Frequency be Associated with Earlier Age at Menarche?,"Early age at menarche is associated with increased breast cancer risk. Red meat consumption in adolescence predicts breast cancer risk, but it is unknown whether it is also related to earlier menarche. We studied the association between intake of red meat at ages 5-12 y and age at menarche in a prospective study. We assessed usual diets with a food-frequency questionnaire in a group of 456 girls aged 8.4 ± 1.7 y and followed them for a median 5.6 y in Bogotá, Colombia. Girls were asked periodically about the occurrence and date of menarche. Median age at menarche was estimated with use of Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities by categories of red meat intake frequency. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the incidence of menarche by red meat intake frequency, adjusting for potential sociodemographic and dietary confounders including total energy intake and intake frequency of other animal food groups (dairy, poultry, freshwater fish, tuna/sardines, eggs, and innards). Median age at menarche was 12.4 y. After adjustment for total energy intake, maternal parity, and socioeconomic status, red meat intake frequency was inversely associated with age at menarche. When compared with girls with red meat intake <4 times/wk, those consuming it ≥2 times/d had a significantly earlier age at menarche (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.41; P-trend = 0.0009). Incidentally, we found that girls with tuna/sardine intake >1 time/wk had a significantly later age at menarche (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.90; P = 0.01) than those with intake <1 time/mo. Intake frequency of other animal food groups was not significantly associated with age at menarche.","Higher red meat intake frequency during childhood is associated with an earlier age at menarche, whereas greater fatty fish intake frequency is associated with a later menarcheal age.",closed_qa
Is model for end stage of liver disease ( MELD ) better than the Child-Pugh score for predicting in-hospital mortality related to esophageal variceal bleeding?,"The Child Pugh and MELD are good methods for predicting mortality in patients with chronic liver disease. We investigated their performance as risk factors for failure to control bleeding, in-hospital overall mortality and death related to esophageal variceal bleeding episodes. From a previous collected database, 212 cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding admitted to our hospital were studied. The predictive capability of Child Pugh and MELD scores were compared using c statistics. The Child-Pugh and MELD scores showed marginal capability for predicting failure to control bleeding (the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) values were < 0.70 for both). The AUROC values for predicting in-hospital overall mortality of Child-Pugh and MELD score were similar: 0.809 (CI 95%, 0.710 - 0.907) and 0.88 (CI 95% 0.77- 0.99,) respectively. There was no significant difference between them (p > 0.05). The AUROC value of MELD for predicting mortality related to variceal bleeding was higher than the Child-Pugh score: 0.905 (CI 95% 0.801-1.00) vs 0.794 (CI 95% 0.676 - 0.913) respectively (p < 0.05).","MELD and Child-Pugh were not efficacious scores for predicting failure to control bleeding.

Does rosuvastatin improve vascular function of arteriovenous fistula in a diabetic rat model?,"This study investigates the pathogenesis of arteriovenous (AV) fistula failure in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and tests the vascular protective effect of rosuvastatin on the fistulous communication of diabetic rats. DM was induced in rats by a single injection of streptozotocin. One week later, a fistula was created in the descending aorta and the adjacent inferior vena cava (aortocaval [AC] fistula). Rats were then randomly assigned to receive placebo or rosuvastatin (15 mg/kg/d) in chow for 2 weeks. Blood flow in the aortic segments of the fistula was measured. Circulating CD34+/KDR+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were determined 2 weeks after creation of the AC fistulas using flow cytometry. Vascular function of the AC fistulas was assessed by isometric force testing. The expression of proinflammatory genes and generation of superoxide anions in the fistulas were examined. The number of EPCs was reduced in diabetic rats, and rosuvastatin significantly increased the number of circulating EPCs. Reduced blood flow and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in the AC fistula of animals with diabetes was significantly potentiated after treatment with rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin also attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and generation of superoxide anions in the fistula tissues isolated from diabetic rats.",We provide the first evidence demonstrating that rosuvastatin improves blood flow and endothelial function of AC fistulas in rats with DM by attenuating the activity of proinflammatory genes and generation of superoxide anions in the remodeled vasculature.,closed_qa
Do airway epithelial cells promote transmigration of eosinophils in a new three-dimensional chemotaxis model?,"Prominent infiltration of eosinophils in airway mucosa is the pathognomonic sign of asthma. The role of airway epithelial cells in eosinophil infiltration, however, has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to develop a new in vitro transmigration system composed of airway epithelial cells and extracellular matrix, and to investigate the role of airway epithelial cells in eosinophil infiltration. A layer of type I collagen gel was formed in Netwell, and BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells were cultured on the gel. Then the wells covered with epithelial monolayer were filled with medium, inverted, and new upper chambers were constructed on the gel side by applying a ring cap. After further incubation with or without exogenous cytokines for 48 h, eosinophils or neutrophils were loaded in upper chambers (the gel side) and cells transmigrated to lower chambers (the epithelial cell side) were counted. Immunohistochemical analyses were also performed. While a simple collagen gel hardly promoted eosinophil migration even in the presence of eotaxin or RANTES, significant numbers of eosinophils migrated to lower chambers in the presence of the epithelial cells. Replacement of medium in the lower chamber (the epithelial cell side) with fresh medium, addition of exogenous eotaxin or RANTES in the upper chamber (the gel side), or pre-treatment of eosinophils with anti-CCR3 all inhibited transmigration. We found that the epithelial cells produced and deposited extracellular matrix proteins such as type IV collagen onto the type I collagen gel. Separately, we found that type IV collagen itself was capable of enhancing eotaxin-induced eosinophil migration in a standard chemotaxis assay. Neutrophils also efficiently migrated in the present transmigration system. Pre-treatment of epithelial cells with TNF-alpha and IL-4 enhanced eosinophil transmigration, while that of neutrophils was enhanced by TNF-alpha but suppressed by IL-4.","By utilizing a new in vitro transmigration system mimicking the airway mucosa, we have demonstrated that airway epithelial cells play an essential role in transmigration of eosinophils and that multiple factors such as chemokines, extracellular matrix proteins and exogenous inflammatory cytokines are involved in efficient transmigration.",closed_qa
Does long bone histology of sauropterygia from the lower Muschelkalk of the Germanic basin provide unexpected implications for phylogeny?,"Sauropterygia is an abundant and successful group of Triassic marine reptiles. Phylogenetic relationships of Triassic Sauropterygia have always been unstable and recently questioned. Although specimens occur in high numbers, the main problems are rareness of diagnostic material from the Germanic Basin and uniformity of postcranial morphology of eosauropterygians. In the current paper, morphotypes of humeri along with their corresponding bone histologies for Lower to Middle Muschelkalk sauropterygians are described and interpreted for the first time in a phylogenetic context. Nothosaurus shows a typical plesiomorphic lamellar-zonal bone type, but varying growth patterns and the occurrence of a new humerus morphotype point to a higher taxonomic diversity than was known. In contrast to the enormous morphological variability of eosauropterygian humeri not assigned to Nothosaurus, their long bone histology is relatively uniform and can be divided into two histotypes. Unexpectedly, both of these histotypes reveal abundant fibrolamellar bone throughout the cortex. This pushes the origin of fibrolamellar bone in Sauropterygia back from the Cretaceous to the early Middle Triassic (early Anisian). Histotype A is assigned to Cymatosaurus, a basal member of the Pistosauroidea, which includes the plesiosaurs as derived members. Histotype B is related to the pachypleurosaur Anarosaurus. Contrary to these new finds, the stratigraphically younger pachypleurosaur Neusticosaurus shows the plesiomorphic lamellar-zonal bone type and an incomplete endochondral ossification, like Nothosaurus.","Histological results hypothetically discussed in a phylogenetical context have a large impact on the current phylogenetic hypothesis of Sauropterygia, leaving the pachypleurosaurs polyphyletic. On the basis of histological data, Neusticosaurus would be related to Nothosaurus, whereas Anarosaurus would follow the pistosaur clade. Furthermore, the presence of fibrolamellar bone, which is accompanied with increased growth rates and presumably even with increased metabolic rates, already in Anarosaurus and Cymatosaurus can explain the success of the Pistosauroidea, the only sauropterygian group to survive into the Jurassic and give rise to the pelagic plesiosaur radiation.",closed_qa
Is obesity associated with worse overall survival in women with low-grade papillary serous epithelial ovarian cancer?,"The objective of this study was to evaluate prognostic risk factors for survival in women with low-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (LGSC). A multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with LGSC was conducted. Potential epidemiologic risk factors evaluated included obesity, age, parity, race, smoking, oral contraceptive pill and/or hormonal replacement therapy use, and previous hysterectomy or surgery on fallopian tubes and/or ovaries. Additional factors included stage, extent of debulking, residual disease, and disease status. Eighty-one patients were identified, and pathologic diagnosis was independently confirmed. Median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 21-86 years). Thirty-four percent were obese, and 80% had optimally debulked disease. Forty-six percent were alive, 14% with disease, whereas 25% were dead of disease, 2% died of intercurrent disease, and 27% had an unknown status. In a univariate analysis, optimal surgical debulking was associated with improved progression-free survival (P = 0.01), disease-specific survival (P = 0.03), and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) and body mass index with worse OS (P = 0.05). On multivariate analysis, obesity (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-7.3; P = 0.04) and optimal tumor debulking (hazard ratio, 0.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.008-0.29; P = 0.001) were a significant predictor of OS.","In a multivariate analysis, obesity and optimal tumor cytoreduction were significant predictors of OS. However, obesity was not associated with worse disease-specific survival, suggesting that mortality of obese patients with LGSC may result from other comorbidities. Interventions addressing obesity may improve survival for women diagnosed with LGSC, and further study is warranted to address the role of obesity in LGSC.",closed_qa
Do t84-intestinal epithelial exosomes bear MHC class II/peptide complexes potentiating antigen presentation by dendritic cells?,"Intestinal epithelial cells release antigen-presenting vesicles (exosomes) bearing major histocompatibility complex class II/peptide complexes stimulating specific immune responses in vivo. To characterize further the role of human epithelial exosomes in antigen presentation, their capacity to load antigenic peptides, bind immune target cells, and induce T-cell activation was analyzed in vitro. The capacity of exosomes derived from the HLA-DR4-expressing, intestinal epithelial cell line T84 to load the HLA-DR4-specific peptide (3)H-HSA 64-76 and to activate a HLA-DR4-restricted T-cell hybridoma was tested in the presence or absence of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Interaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled exosomes with T cells and DCs was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. T84-derived exosomes, enriched in CD9, CD81, CD82, and A33 antigen, were capable of binding specifically human serum albumin (HSA) 64-76 peptide on HLA-DR4 molecules and of interacting preferentially with DCs. HSA-loaded exosomes were unable to activate the T-cell hybridoma directly but induced a productive T-cell activation through DCs. When HSA peptide was bound to exosomal HLA-DR4 molecules instead of in a soluble form, the threshold of peptide presentation by DCs was markedly decreased (x10(-3)).","Exosomes released by intestinal epithelial cells bear exogenous peptides complexed to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and interact preferentially with DCs, strongly potentiating peptide presentation to T cells. Epithelial exosomes constitute a powerful link between luminal antigens and local immune cells by mediating the transfer of tiny amounts of luminal antigenic information and facilitating immune surveillance at mucosal surfaces.",closed_qa
Is technetium-99m-MIBI taken up by the normal pituitary gland?,"The aim of this study was to compare the behavioral uptake of a normal gland and a pituitary adenoma and to assess the ability to diagnose pituitary adenoma by means of technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The study included 15 patients with pituitary adenomas (mean age = 44.0 years, range 19-63) and 15 control subjects (mean age = 50.7 years, range 20-67). SPECT was performed 15 minutes after an intravenous injection of MIBI 600 MBq. The shape and location of MIBI uptake were evaluated on a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging/SPECT registration image. The shape patterns and location were classified as follows: Shape C (circular); LO (longitudinal oval); T/R (triangular or rectangular) and location P (pituitary gland or adenoma); D/C (dorsum sellae and/or clivus). Analysis of the uptake showed that 10 (67%) adenomas were C, and 5 (33%) were LO. Of the controls, 5 (33%) were C, and 10 (69%) were T/R. With regard to location, all patients with pituitary adenomas were classified as P, and all control subjects (93%) but one showed uptake in the dorsum sellae and clivus (D/C).",MIBI was taken up in the dorsum sellae or clivus but not the normal pituitary gland and had a strong affinity for the pituitary adenoma. This result implies that MIBI SPECT may be a useful new auxiliary examination technique for the location diagnosis of pituitary adenoma.,closed_qa
Does a novel nonsynonymous variant of matrix metalloproteinase-7 confer risk of liver cirrhosis?,"Liver cirrhosis is characterized by progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix following chronic liver injuries. In the extracellular space, the constant turnover of liver matrix is regulated by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) class of enzyme. To assess whether genetic variations in MMP would result in diversity of liver cirrhosis, a case-control study of 320 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, with or without cirrhosis, was conducted. Ten single-nucleotide polymorphism markers from four potential fibrosis-associated genes were selected for genotyping. Among these genes, a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism which generates the variation of Gly-137 and Asp-137 in the MMP-7 gene was found to be strongly associated with the development of liver cirrhosis. In contrast to MMP-7(Gly-137) that predominantly secretes out into the cell culture medium, the cirrhosis-associated MMP-7(Asp-137) variant is preferentially localized on the extracellular membranes where it exerts its proteolytic activity on pericellular substrates. Functional analysis demonstrated an increased ability of the MMP-7(Asp-137) variant to associate with the cell surface CD151 molecule. In wound-healing and Boyden chamber assays, cell motility was specifically enhanced with the expression of MMP-7(Asp-137) as compared to the cells expressing MMP-7(Gly-137). These results demonstrate that the MMP-7(Asp-137) variant confers a gain-of-function phenotype for MMP-7.",We have identified a novel genetic association of MMP-7(Asp-137) variant with liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Whether the MMP-7 variant can be a new marker for liver cirrhosis will be further studied.,closed_qa
Do acute ethanol exposure combined with burn injury enhances IL-6 levels in the murine ileum?,"Recent studies suggest that ethanol use imposes a greater risk of trauma-associated intestinal injury than trauma alone. The initiating and regulatory factors for multiple organ dysfunction syndromes are not well defined, yet evidence points to the gut as a possible trigger of the systemic inflammatory cascade as well as a potential source of cytokines. In the current study, we hypothesized that ethanol administration would alter cytokine levels and intestinal infiltration by neutrophils within the ileum of mice exposed to burn injury (15% total body surface of dorsal skin). Ileal samples were collected for histological assessment, myeloperoxidase quantitation and the protein presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL-) 6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2; CXCL2) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Additional ileal tissue samples were examined for localization of the IL-6 immunoreactivity. We did not detect statistically significant cytokine/chemokine differences (MIP-2 and IL-10) between sham control and treatment conditions at either 2 or 24 hours. However, there was a significant decrease in TNFalpha at 24 hours in both burn injury alone and in combination with ethanol treatment conditions (p < 0.05). In addition, there was an increase in IL-6 levels at 24 hours in intestinal tissue obtained from mice subjected to a combination of acute ethanol and burn injury, compared to the mice receiving burn or sham injury (p < 0.001). Ileal homogenate increases in IL-6 at 24 hours were concurrent with decreased villus height in the ileum, but no discernable changes in neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity levels) at either 2 or 24 hours. Additional immunocytochemical localization studies of ileal tissue revealed that there was a substantial increase of IL-6 in intestinal enterocytes subjected to both burn injury alone, or in combination with acute ethanol exposure.",The present study suggests that acute ethanol exposure combined with burn injury enhances levels of IL-6 protein in the ileum. The enhanced levels of ileal IL-6 are likely due to enterocyte production of the cytokine.,closed_qa
Does protein kinase C-delta regulate migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2?,"Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are early and crucial events in the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia, the primary cause of restenosis after vascular intervention. We tested the hypothesis that protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta), a ubiquitously expressed intracellular protein kinase, regulates vascular SMC proliferation and migration. Exogenous PKCdelta was expressed in cultured SMCs via stable transfection or adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Conversely, endogenous PKCdelta was inhibited by means of targeted gene deletion (gene knock-out). Cell proliferation and migration were determined by (3)H-thymidine incorporation and 24-well transwell assay, respectively. We isolated and examined three A10 SMC lines in which PKCdelta was stably transfected. Compared with cells that were transfected with an empty vector, cells transfected with PKCdelta exhibited reduced ability to proliferate. Moreover, PKCdelta transfection inhibited SMC migration toward platelet-derived growth factor-BB. Similar inhibitory effects on proliferation and migration were also observed when PKCdelta was introduced into primary aortic SMCs via an adenoviral vector. Interestingly, SMCs isolated from PKCdelta knockout mice also displayed decreased chemotaxis and proliferation compared with PKCdelta(+/+) littermates, suggesting a complex yet critical role for PKCdelta. We studied the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 as a possible signaling pathway for PKCdelta's inhibitory effect. PKCdelta overexpression diminished ERK1/2 activity. Molecular restoration of ERK activation reversed the inhibitory effect of PKCdelta on SMC proliferation and migration.","We demonstrate that although normal migration and proliferation is lessened in SMCs deficient in PKCdelta, its prolonged activation also diminishes those behaviors. This suggests a dual, critical role for PKCdelta in SMC proliferation and migration, and thus intimal hyperplasia and restenosis.",closed_qa
Is the enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase deficient in primary hyperoxaluria type 3?,"Mutations in the 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA1) gene have been recently identified in patients with atypical primary hyperoxaluria (PH). However, it was not clearly established whether these mutations caused disease via loss of function or activation of the gene product. Whole-gene sequencing of HOGA1 was conducted in 28 unrelated patients with a high clinical suspicion of PH and in whom Types 1 and 2 had been excluded. Fifteen patients were homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in HOGA1. In total, seven different mutations were identified including three novel changes: a missense mutation, c.107C > T (p.Ala36Val), and two nonsense mutations c.117C > A (p.Tyr39X) and c.208C > T (p.Arg70X) as well as the previously documented c.860G > T (p.Gly297Val), c.907C > T (p.Arg303Cys) and in-frame c.944_946delAGG (p.Glu315del) mutations. The recurrent c.700 + 5G > T splice site mutation in intron 5 was most common with a frequency of 67%. Expression studies on hepatic messenger RNA demonstrated the pathogenicity of this mutation.","The detection of a patient with two novel nonsense mutations within exon 1 of the gene, c.117C > A (p.Tyr39X) and c.208C > T (p.Arg70X), provides definitive proof that PH Type 3 is due to deficiency of the 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase enzyme.",closed_qa
Dental care before lung transplantation: are we being too rigorous?,"Poor dental status is known to cause infections in severely sick and in elderly patients. In patients awaiting lung transplantation, rigorous dental treatment is a common prerequisite, although evidence-based data are lacking with regard to extent, necessity and effect on post-transplantation infectious status. In the present retrospective study, dental status [dental history (missing teeth, caries, tooth restorations and extractions, prevalence of periodontitis) and dental treatment prior transplantation] was assessed in 85 lung transplant candidates at the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany and evaluated for infectious foci in the first 3 years following transplantation. Forty-nine patients got transplanted in the observed timespan. Total tooth count differed significantly between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16 ± 9), pulmonary fibrosis (22 ± 7) or cystic fibrosis (30 ± 3) patients prior transplantation (P > 0.001). Periodontitis prevalence yielded no difference and was mainly not treated prior transplantation. No dental-related infectious focus could be diagnosed post-transplantation. However, 15% of post-transplantation infections were of unknown focus, and infection rate was increased in year 2 post-transplantation in patients without periodontitis.","No clearly defined dental foci were registered following transplantation. This raises the question of whether current dental treatment in these highly compromised patients is too rigorous with regard to tooth extractions. However, no focus could be detected in 15% of the registered infections. Therefore, controversially, post-transplantation dental care could also be insufficient with regard to undertreated periodontitis.",closed_qa
Media coverage of celebrity DUIs: teachable moments or problematic social modeling?,"Qualitative analysis of US media coverage of four female celebrities (Michelle Rodriguez, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie and Lindsay Lohan) was conducted over the year following their DUI arrest (December 2005 through June 2008).

Is n-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced retinal degeneration in mice independent of the p53 gene?,"A single systemic administration of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) causes retinal degeneration involving photoreceptor cell loss within 7 days. MNU-induced photoreceptor cell loss is due to apoptosis and is a reliable animal model for human retinitis pigmentosa. The purpose of this study was to determine if p53 contributes to the development of MNU-induced retinal degeneration in mice. Eight-week-old p53(-/-), p53(+/-), and p53(+/+) mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg bodyweight of MNU. Age-matched p53(+/+) mice received the vehicle only (physiologic saline containing 0.05% acetic acid). Mice were sacrificed and necropsied 7 days after the treatment. Both eyes were examined histologically and morphometrically to determine retinal thickness, photoreceptor cell ratio, and retinal damage ratio. No mice died during the experiment, but the p53 null mice treated with MNU had a statistically significant weight loss compared to the other groups. Histologically, all MNU-treated mice, regardless of p53 gene status, experienced retinal degeneration characterized by photoreceptor cell loss (the disappearance of the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor layer) in both the central and peripheral retina. All MNU-treated mice had significantly decreased retinal thickness and photoreceptor cell ratios at the central and peripheral retina and an increased retinal damage ratio compared to the vehicle-treated control. The retinal changes caused by MNU in p53(+/+), p53(+/-), and p53(-/-) mice were not significantly different and hence were related to a p53-independent apoptotic mechanism.","Because the absence of p53 did not prevent photoreceptor cell loss, we conclude that p53 is not essential for MNU-mediated photoreceptor cell degeneration.",closed_qa
Is combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy equally effective as surgical resection in localized esophageal carcinoma?,"This is a retrospective cohort comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation versus esophagectomy in nonmetastatic esophageal cancers. Between 1984 and 1994, 82 patients received concurrent chemotherapy and radiation as their primary treatment. Their treatment consisted of 50-60 Gy of radiation in 20-30 fractions over 4-6 weeks, concurrent with bolus mitomycin C (8 mg/m2) on day 1, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion (20 mg/kg/day) +/- leucovorin (20 mg/m2/day) on days 1-4 and 22-25. This group was compared to another cohort of 81 patients who had esophagectomy. Both groups were restaged according to the 1983 AJCC clinical staging system and there was more clinical Stage III disease in the chemoradiation group, 30% versus 16%. The complete response rate was 68% after chemoradiation (by clinical assessment) and 83% for esophagectomy (by pathological assessment). At 5 years, the local relapse rate was 59% for chemoradiation and 51% for esophagectomy. The 5-year disease-free rate and survival were 23% and 25% for chemoradiation, and 21% and 23% for esophagectomy respectively. There was no significant difference in the disease control and survival between the two treatments. The pretreatment AJCC clinical stage was a strong prognosticator of outcome. The 5-year survival was 55% for Stage I, 16% for Stage II, and 8% for Stage III (p = 0.00003).",Combined chemotherapy and radiation appeared to be as effective as esophagectomy in localized esophageal cancer.,closed_qa
Is para-aortic workup in locally advanced cervical cancer : heterogeneity still the rule . Results from a retrospective multicenter study?,"We retrospectively studied the different strategies of para-aortic (PA) staging of patients with PA involvement in locally advanced cervical cancer as conducted in eight centers in France and their impact upon survival and management. All patients enrolled in this multicenter study presented with cervical cancer with PA involvement. The diagnosis of PA spread was based on imaging assessment of the PA area and/or pathological examination of harvested PA lymph nodes when staging lymphadenectomy was performed. Imaging modalities comprised positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography. Survival outcomes were evaluated retrospectively. One hundred and fifteen women were retrospectively studied. Radiological staging was conducted in 101 (87.8 %) patients. PET was performed in 66 patients (57.4 %). Its FN rate was 22.7 % (15/66) and its sensitivity 77.3 %. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy was conducted in a large proportion of patients (67.8 %). Its indications were not restricted to negative radiological workup. The lymphadenectomy rate was significantly higher in patients with earlier stages (p = 0.02) and lower tumor volume (p = 0.01). Treatment consisted of chemoradiation therapy with extended-field radiotherapy in all patients, followed by intracavitary brachytherapy in 94 cases (81.7 %) and completion surgery in 69 cases (60 %). Patients without para-aortic metastasis on radiological examination were more likely to receive all treatment modalities (p = 0.04).","Despite established recommendations, our results point out the tremendous heterogeneity regarding para-aortic assessment. These differences in management are perhaps related to a recommended therapeutic strategy that does not appear to improve the poor prognosis associated with PA involvement.",closed_qa
Is partial antagonism of propofol anaesthesia by physostigmine in rats associated with potentiation of fast ( 80-200 Hz ) oscillations in the thalamus?,"Positron emission tomography studies in human subjects show that propofol-induced unconsciousness in humans is associated with a reduction in thalamic blood flow, suggesting that anaesthesia is associated with impairment of thalamic function. A recent study showed that antagonism of propofol-induced unconsciousness by the anticholinesterase physostigmine is associated with a marked increase in thalamic blood flow, supporting the implication of the thalamus. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of the thalamus in the antagonistic effects of physostigmine during propofol anaesthesia using electrophysiological recordings in a rat model. Local field potentials were recorded from the barrel cortex and ventroposteromedial thalamic nucleus in 10 chronically instrumented rats to measure spectral power in the gamma/high-gamma range (50-200 Hz). Propofol was given i.v. by target-controlled infusion at the lowest concentration required to abolish righting attempts. Physostigmine was given during anaesthesia to produce behavioural arousal without changing anaesthetic concentration. Compared with baseline, gamma/high-gamma power during anaesthesia was reduced by 31% in the cortex (P=0.006) and by 65% in the thalamus (P=0.006). Physostigmine given during anaesthesia increased gamma/high-gamma power in the thalamus by 60% (P=0.048) and caused behavioural arousal that correlated (P=0.0087) with the increase in power. Physostigmine caused no significant power change in the cortex.",We conclude that partial antagonism of propofol anaesthesia by physostigmine is associated with an increase in thalamic activity reflected in gamma/high-gamma (50-200 Hz) power. These findings are consistent with the view that anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness is associated with impairment of thalamic function.,closed_qa
Is testosterone associated with the cardiovascular autonomic response to a stressor in healthy men?,"Men have high cardiovascular risk and unfavourable cardiac autonomic tone compared to premenopausal women. The role of sex hormones in control of autonomic tone is unclear. We sought to determine the association between sex hormones and cardiosympathovagal tone at baseline and in response to a physiological stressor. Forty-eight healthy subjects (21 men, 27 premenopausal women) were studied in high-salt balance. Cardiac autonomic tone was assessed by heart rate variability, calculated by spectral power analysis (low frequency (LF, a measure of sympathetic modulation), high frequency (HF, a measure of vagal modulation) and LF:HF (a measure of cardiosympathovagal balance)) at baseline and in response to graded Angiotensin II (AngII) infusion (3 ng/kg/min × 30 min, 6 ng/kg/min × 30 min) were measured. The primary outcome was association between endogenous sex hormone levels and measures of cardiac autonomic tone. All subjects had sex hormone levels in the normal range. No associations were observed between sex hormones and baseline cardiac autonomic tone in men or women. Men with lower testosterone levels, however, were unable to maintain both cardiosympathetic (p = 0.045) and cardiovagal tone (p = 0.035) in response to AngII even after adjustments for covariates. No association was observed between estradiol and progesterone and cardiac autonomic response to AngII in either sex.",An unfavourable shift in the cardiac autonomic tone in men with lower testosterone levels was observed in response to a stressor. Understanding the role of sex hormones in modulation of cardiac autonomic tone may help guide risk reduction strategies in men.,closed_qa
Is ablation of junctin or triadin associated with increased cardiac injury following ischaemia/reperfusion?,"Junctin and triadin are calsequestrin-binding proteins that regulate sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release by interacting with the ryanodine receptor. The levels of these proteins are significantly down-regulated in failing human hearts. However, the significance of such decreases is currently unknown. Here, we addressed the functional role of these accessory proteins in the heart's responses to ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Isolated mouse hearts were subjected to global I/R, and contractile parameters were assessed in wild-type (WT), junctin-knockout (JKO), and triadin-knockout (TKO) hearts. Both JKO and TKO were associated with significantly depressed post-I/R contractile recovery. However, ablation of triadin resulted in the most severe post-I/R phenotype. The additional contractile impairment of TKO hearts was not related to a mitochondrial death pathway, but attributed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis. Activation of the X-box-binding protein-1 and transcriptional up-regulation of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) provided a molecular mechanism of caspase-12-dependent apoptosis in myocytes. In addition, elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) during reperfusion was associated with the activation of calpain proteases and troponin I breakdown. Accordingly, treatment with the calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 significantly ameliorated post-I/R impairment of contractile recovery in intact hearts.","These findings indicate that deficiency of either junctin or triadin impairs the contractile recovery in post-ischaemic hearts, which appears to be primarily attributed to increased ER stress and activation of calpain.",closed_qa
Does high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation decrease cerebral vasomotor reactivity?,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been recently employed as a therapeutic strategy for stroke, although its effects on cerebral hemodynamics has been poorly investigated. This study aims to examine the impact of high frequency rTMS on cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR). Twenty-nine healthy subjects were randomly assigned to real (19) or sham 17-Hz rTMS, applied on primary motor cortex (M1) of the dominant hemisphere. All subjects underwent Transcranial Doppler of the middle cerebral arteries to evaluate mean flow velocity and VMR before (T(0)) and within 10 min (T(1)) following rTMS. Four subjects underwent further VMR evaluations at 2 (T(2)), 5 (T(3)) and 24 h (T(4)) after rTMS. As a control condition, 10 subjects underwent real (5) or sham rTMS on calcarine cortex. In addition, five acute stroke patients underwent five daily rTMS sessions on the affected hemisphere mimicking a therapeutic trial. Following real rTMS on M1 (p=0.002) and calcarine cortex (p<0.001) VMR decreased with respect to T(0) in both hemispheres, while no change was observed after sham rTMS (p>0.6). VMR tended to remain lower than T(0) until T(3.) Cerebral VMR decreased independently of the stimulated side also in the patients' group.","High frequency rTMS reduces cerebral VMR, possibly as a secondary effect on autonomic control of cerebral hemodynamics.",closed_qa
Does diabetes mellitus with or without gallstones increase the risk of gallbladder cancer?,"Previous studies have suggested that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for gallbladder cancer; however, it remains unclear whether DM with or without gallstones increases the risk of gallbladder cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for gallbladder cancer, including sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gallstones, and DM. The study cohort consisted of 214,179 subjects newly diagnosed with diabetes (cases) collected from the claims data of the Health Insurance Program of Taiwan from 2000 to 2001 who were retrospectively enrolled. The control group consisted of 206,860 subjects without diabetes, matched with the cases for sex, age, and index year. The subjects were followed up until the end of 2008. The effects of the risk factors on the incidence of gallbladder cancer were evaluated with Cox's proportional hazard regression models. The risk of gallbladder cancer was higher in the DM group than in the non-DM group, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.53 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.90]. Gallstones were also a risk factor for gallbladder cancer, with an HR of 2.52 (95 % CI 1.11-5.73). DM and gallstones were synergistic risk factors for gallbladder cancer (p < 0.0001), with an HR of 5.37 (95 % CI 3.17-9.10) for subjects with both diseases in relation to those with neither of these conditions.","In the present long-term cohort study, DM with or without gallstones increased the risk of gallbladder cancer. Gallstones were independently related to gallbladder cancer, and DM and gallstones were synergistic risk factors for gallbladder cancer.",closed_qa
Is pRb required for MEF2-dependent gene expression as well as cell-cycle arrest during skeletal muscle differentiation?,"The onset of differentiation-specific gene expression in skeletal muscle is coupled to permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle. The retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein (pRb) is a critical regulator of this process, required for both cell-cycle arrest in G0 phase and high-level expression of late muscle-differentiation markers. Although the cell-cycle defects that are seen in pRb-deficient myocytes can be explained by the well-described function of pRb as a negative regulator of the transition from G1 to S phase, it remains unclear how pRb positively affects late muscle-gene expression. Here, we show that the myogenic defect in Rb-/- cells corresponds to a deficiency in the activity of the transcription factor MEF2. Without pRb, MyoD induces the accumulation of nuclear-localized MEF2 that is competent to bind DNA yet transcriptionally inert. When pRb is present, MyoD stimulates the function of the MEF2C transcriptional activation domain and the activity of endogenous MEF2-type factors. Co-transfection of MyoD together with an activated form of MEF2C containing the Herpesvirus VP16 transcriptional activation domain partially bypasses the requirement for pRb and induces late muscle-gene expression in replicating cells. This ectopic myogenesis is nevertheless significantly augmented by co-expression of an E2F1-pRb chimeric protein that blocks the cell cycle.",These findings indicate that pRb promotes the expression of late-stage muscle-differentiation markers by both inhibiting cell-cycle progression and cooperating with MyoD to promote the transcriptional activation activity of MEF2.,closed_qa
Does the UlaG protein family define novel structural and functional motifs grafted on an ancient RNase fold?,"Bacterial populations are highly successful at colonizing new habitats and adapting to changing environmental conditions, partly due to their capacity to evolve novel virulence and metabolic pathways in response to stress conditions and to shuffle them by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). A common theme in the evolution of new functions consists of gene duplication followed by functional divergence. UlaG, a unique manganese-dependent metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) enzyme involved in L-ascorbate metabolism by commensal and symbiotic enterobacteria, provides a model for the study of the emergence of new catalytic activities from the modification of an ancient fold. Furthermore, UlaG is the founding member of the so-called UlaG-like (UlaGL) protein family, a recently established and poorly characterized family comprising divalent (and perhaps trivalent) metal-binding MBLs that catalyze transformations on phosphorylated sugars and nucleotides. Here we combined protein structure-guided and sequence-only molecular phylogenetic analyses to dissect the molecular evolution of UlaG and to study its phylogenomic distribution, its relatedness with present-day UlaGL protein sequences and functional conservation. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that UlaGL sequences are present in Bacteria and Archaea, with bona fide orthologs found mainly in mammalian and plant-associated Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The incongruence between the UlaGL tree and known species trees indicates exchange by HGT and suggests that the UlaGL-encoding genes provided a growth advantage under changing conditions. Our search for more distantly related protein sequences aided by structural homology has uncovered that UlaGL sequences have a common evolutionary origin with present-day RNA processing and metabolizing MBL enzymes widespread in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. This observation suggests an ancient origin for the UlaGL family within the broader trunk of the MBL superfamily by duplication, neofunctionalization and fixation.","Our results suggest that the forerunner of UlaG was present as an RNA metabolizing enzyme in the last common ancestor, and that the modern descendants of that ancestral gene have a wide phylogenetic distribution and functional roles. We propose that the UlaGL family evolved new metabolic roles among bacterial and possibly archeal phyla in the setting of a close association with metazoans, such as in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract or in animal and plant pathogens, as well as in environmental settings. Accordingly, the major evolutionary forces shaping the UlaGL family include vertical inheritance and lineage-specific duplication and acquisition of novel metabolic functions, followed by HGT and numerous lineage-specific gene loss events.",closed_qa
"Are patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass to treat atherosclerotic vascular disease underprescribed cardioprotective medications : effect on graft patency , limb salvage , and mortality?","Established American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of statin drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents in patients with systemic atherosclerosis, such as those undergoing operative intervention to treat peripheral atherosclerotic disease. Many of these patients have not received treatment of coronary heart disease and have not been prescribed these medications. Whether statin drugs and ACE inhibitors confer an improvement in graft patency, limb salvage, and operative mortality is unknown. Consecutive patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass between 1997 and 2002 were evaluated for demographic data, comorbid disease, medication use, as well as cumulative graft patency, limb salvage, and mortality. Univariate, multivariate logistical regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed. P <.05 was considered significant. Two hundred ninety-three patients (mean age, 64 years; 67% men) underwent 338 infrainguinal bypass procedures with autologous vein (n = 218), prosthetic grafts (n = 88), or composite prosthetic-vein grafts (n = 32). Limb salvage was the operative indication in 75% of procedures. Coexisting diseases included hypertension (70%), diabetes (52%), hyperlipidemia (37%), coronary heart disease (51%), congestive heart failure (14%), and active tobacco use (30%). Statin drugs were taken by 56% of patients, ACE inhibitors by 54% of patients, and antiplatelet agents or warfarin sodium (Coumadin) by 93% of patients. Postoperative graft surveillance was done in 39% of patients. Cumulative graft patency was 73%, limb salvage was 85%, and mortality was 9%, with a mean follow-up of 17 months. Factors independently associated with increased graft patency included statin drug use (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-6.4), male sex (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-5.0), and graft surveillance (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5). Factors associated with decreased amputation rate were statin drug use (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 6.15-0.77) and graft surveillance (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 6.1-0.63). Factors associated with decreased mortality included graft surveillance (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.1-0.56), whereas congestive heart failure (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.5-17) and hemodialysis-dependent renal failure (OR, 29; 95% CI, 6.1-140) were associated with increased mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that only ACE inhibitors were associated with lower mortality (P =.05)","Patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass are undertreated with respect to cardioprotective medications. ACE inhibitor use is associated with lower mortality, and statin drug use is associated with improved graft patency and limb salvage.

Is scuba diving associated with high prevalence of headache : a cross-sectional study in men?,"To study the prevalence of cephalalgia in male divers. Scuba divers work in stressing environments and have a high cerebrovascular risk, both conditions which are supposed to contribute to the genesis of cephalalgia. However, no study assessed expressly the prevalence of cephalalgia in divers, to date. We enrolled 201 professional male scuba divers (41.0 ± 7.2 years) and controls (41.1 ± 7.2 years), and the risk ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence of suffering from cephalalgia was calculated. We found that 16% of divers and 22% of matched controls were affected by cephalalgia (P > .05), accounting for a risk ratio of 0.71 (95% CI 0.47-1.07). Divers reported fewer attacks per month (1.8 ± 0.7, n = 32) with regard to controls (2.5 ± 1.8, n = 45) (P = .02), but no differences concerning age at onset and severity were detected (P > .05). Divers suffered from migraine, migraine with aura and tension headache as much as controls.","Scuba diving, an intense physical activity characterized by cerebral micro-vascular distress, is not associated with cephalalgia, as a whole, or migraine, tension headache or migraine with aura, more commonly than in a matched, non-diving, population.

Do bone marrow-derived microglia infiltrate into the paraventricular nucleus of chronic psychological stress-loaded mice?,"Microglia of the central nervous system act as sentinels and rapidly react to infection or inflammation. The pathophysiological role of bone marrow-derived microglia is of particular interest because they affect neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain. The hypothesis of the current study is that chronic psychological stress (chronic PS) induces the infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia into hypothalamus by means of chemokine axes in brain and bone marrow. Here we show that bone marrow-derived microglia specifically infiltrate the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of mice that received chronic PS. Bone marrow derived-microglia are CX3CR1(low)CCR2(+)CXCR4(high), as distinct from CX3CR1(high)CCR2(-)CXCR4(low) resident microglia, and express higher levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) but lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Chronic PS stimulates the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in PVN neurons, reduces stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the bone marrow and increases the frequency of CXCR4(+) monocytes in peripheral circulation. And then a chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) or a β3-adrenoceptor blockade prevents infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia in the PVN.","Chronic PS induces the infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia into PVN, and it is conceivable that the MCP-1/CCR2 axis in PVN and the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in bone marrow are involved in this mechanism.",closed_qa
Do [ Transcultural adaptation into Spanish of the nursing activities score ]?,"Assessment of nursing workload is a common practice in the daily work of nursing care. This is usually done using scales that were not designed for Spanish-speaking countries, which may not take into account the characteristics of the environments that differ from one country to another. The Nursing Activities Score (NAS) has been described as being a useful tool for measuring nursing workload among the instruments used for this measurement in intensive care units. It was aimed to adapt the NAS into Spanish for its use in Spanish intensive care units. The NAS was adapted using translation-back translation method with the participation of both native English speakers who were bilingual in Spanish, and Spanish translators with a high level of English. All of the translators worked individually. A single Spanish version of the scale was obtained, after which a pilot test was made in an Intensive Care Major Burns Unit of the University Hospital of Getafe (Madrid, Spain) with 30 patients and 30 nurses during their regular work shift. We also consulted the primary author of the original description of the NAS regarding items that caused some kind of conflict. Between the original scale and the result of the back-translations to English, we obtained agreement ratings of good in 73%, and appropriate in the remaining 27%. No item was considered to have bad correspondence.",We have developed a Spanish translation of the NAS that appears well matched to the original English version.,closed_qa
Polypodium leucotomos supplementation in the treatment of scalp actinic keratosis: could it improve the efficacy of photodynamic therapy?,"Actinic keratoses (AKs) are a common premalignant skin condition. Many treatments are available for AKs. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the most effective treatments. However, major concerns exist on the possibility of PDT-induced DNA-mutagenesis/immunosuppression, leading to AKs recurrence/treatment failure. An extract (PLE) from the fern polypodium leucotomos reduces UV-induced immunosuppression and mutagenesis. To assess the ability of PLE to enhance the efficacy of PDT treatment, reducing AKs recurrence on the scalp. Thirty-four bald patients presenting at least two AKs on the scalp were alternatively assigned to two groups. Both groups underwent two PDT-sessions one-week apart. The first group began oral PLE supplementation one week after the last PDT session. Evaluation of the effect of PLE supplementation was performed by direct inspection of the bald areas, lesions count, and photodynamic diagnosis assessment at 2 and 6 months. Both groups were homogeneous in terms of skin phototype and previous UV exposure. Mean age was 75.7 ± 7.8 years and 76.5 ± 5.5 years, respectively. Both treatment modalities were successful in reducing AKs number (p<.001). However, PLE supplementation increased clearance rate compared with PDT alone (p = .040).","Polypodium leucotomos improves PDT clearance and decreases AK recurrence rate at 6 months, suggesting its use as a complementary agent in the treatment of field cancerization.",closed_qa
Can repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increase muscle strength in functional neurological paresis?,"Therapeutic options are limited in functional neurological paresis disorder. Earlier intervention studies did not control for a placebo effect, hampering assessment of effectivity. A proof-of-principle investigation was conducted into the therapeutic potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), using a single-blind two-period placebo-controlled cross-over design. Eleven patients received active 15 Hz rTMS over the contralateral motor cortex (hand area), in two periods of 5 days, for 30 min once a day at 80% of resting motor threshold, with a train length of 2 s and an intertrain interval of 4 s. Eight of these eleven patients were also included in the placebo treatment condition. Primary outcome measure was change in muscle strength as measured by dynamometry after treatment. Secondary outcome measure was the subjective change in muscle strength after treatment. In patients who received both treatments, active rTMS induced a significantly larger median increase in objectively measured muscle strength (24%) compared to placebo rTMS (6%; P<0.04). Subjective ratings showed no difference due to treatment, i.e. patients did not perceive these objectively measured motor improvements (P = 0.40).","Our findings suggest that rTMS by itself can potentially improve muscle weakness in functional neurological paresis disorder. Whereas patients' muscle strength increased as measured with dynamometry, patients did not report increased functioning of the affected hand, subjectively. The results may indicate that decreased muscle strength is not the core symptom and that rTMS should be added to behavioral approaches in functional neurological paresis.",closed_qa
Is time to progression dependent on the expression of the tumour suppressor PTEN in ovarian cancer patients?,"Quantitative analyses of PTEN expression of ovarian cancer tissues were performed in this study. PTEN expression was investigated in terms of each patient's progression-free interval to indicate the role of PTEN in the generation of platinum refractory tumours. The study group comprised 20 ovarian cancer patients from whom fresh frozen tissues of both the primary tumour and specimens of progressive disease were available. The PTEN protein and phosphorylation of the downstream effector protein kinase B (PKB) were quantified by Western blot analyses and subsequent densitometry. Data were analyzed for individual PTEN variation with respect to the clinical course as defined by the progression-free interval. Applying the usual clinical criteria for platinum-sensitivity after progression, seven patients were considered platinum-sensitive whereas 13 patients had suffered a progression within 12 months after the chemotherapy. In 5/7 (71%) cases with prolonged time to progression, an increase in PTEN was observed. Decline of PTEN expression occurred in 9/13 (69%) patients with poor outcome. PTEN expression corresponds inversely to PKB phosphorylation in 14/20 (70%) tissues investigated.","The data suggest that decreased PTEN expression accompanies the progression of ovarian cancer. Declining PTEN expression results in a shortened relapse-free interval, whereas an increase of PTEN prolongs the time to progression. However, as far as recurrence occurs, PTEN is not the only mechanism to suppress tumour progression in ovarian cancer.",closed_qa
Is prolonged pregnancy in women associated with attenuated myometrial expression of progesterone receptor co-regulator Krüppel-like Factor 9?,"Late-term pregnancy may lead to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Mice null for the progesterone receptor co-regulator Krüppel-like Factor 9 (KLF9) exhibit delayed parturition and increased incidence of neonatal deaths. Our aim is to evaluate the contribution of myometrial KLF9 to human parturition. Myometrial biopsies were obtained from women with term (>37 to ≤41 wk) and late-term (>41 wk) pregnancies during cesarean delivery and assessed for gene and protein expression. Human myometrial cells transfected with nontargeting or KLF9 small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were treated with the progesterone antagonist RU486 and analyzed for pro-inflammatory chemokine/cytokine gene expression. The study took place in a University-affiliated tertiary care hospital and University research laboratory. Term patients (n = 8) were in spontaneous active labor whereas late-term patients (n = 5) were either in or were induced to active labor, prior to elective cesarean delivery. Steroid hormone receptor, contractility, and inflammation-associated gene expression in myometrial biopsies and in siKLF9-transfected, RU486-treated human myometrial cells was associated with KLF9 expression levels. Myometrium from women with late-term pregnancy showed lower KLF9, total PGR, and PGR-A/PGR-B isoform expression. Transcript levels of select chemokines/cytokines were up- (CSF3, IL1, IL12A, TGFB2) and down- (CCL3, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL15) regulated in late-term relative to term myometrium. Knock-down of KLF9 expression in RU486-treated human myometrial cells modified the expression of PGR and labor-associated cytokines, relative to control siRNA-treated cells.",Myometrial KLF9 may contribute to the onset of human parturition through its regulation of PGR expression and inflammatory signaling networks.,closed_qa
Is helicobacter pylori gastritis in children associated with a regulatory T-cell response?,"Helicobacter pylori infection in children infrequently causes gastroduodenal mucosal ulceration. Because H pylori induces T-cell dependent gastric inflammation in adults and T regulatory (Treg) cells suppress T-cell-dependent pathology, we evaluated gastric histopathology and Treg cell responses in H pylori-infected children and adults. Gastric tissue from 36 children and 79 adults with abdominal symptoms in Santiago, Chile, was evaluated prospectively for H pylori bacteria and histopathology using the Sydney classification and Treg responses using immunoassay, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen (50%) of the children and 51 (65%) of the adults were infected with H pylori. Children and adults were colonized with similar levels of H pylori. However, the level of gastritis in the children was reduced substantially compared with that of the adults (P < .05). Coincident with reduced gastric inflammation, the number of Treg cells and levels of Treg cytokines (transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta1 and interleukin-10) were increased markedly in the gastric mucosa of H pylori-infected children compared with that of infected adults (P < .03 and < .05, respectively). Also, H pylori infection in the children was associated with markedly increased levels of gastric TGF-beta1 and interleukin-10 messenger RNA. Importantly, gastric TGF-beta1 in H pylori-infected children localized predominantly to mucosal CD25(+) and Foxp3(+) cells, indicating a Treg source for the TGF-beta1.","Gastric pathology is reduced and local Treg cell responses are increased in H pylori-infected children compared with infected adults, suggesting that gastric Treg cell responses down-regulate the inflammation and ulceration induced by H pylori in children.",closed_qa
Does multiplex PCR testing require a robust multi-disciplinary strategy to effectively manage identified cases of chlamydial conjunctivitis?,"Implementation of an in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex assay by West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre to improve sample processing means all viral eye swabs are now routinely tested for Adenovirus, Herpes simplex, Varicella and Chlamydia.

A retrospective review of virology results identified 76 Chlamydia-positive patients from 1914 eye swabs (4%) from May 2007 to April 2008. Of these results, 12 originated from Glasgow eye casualty and available clinical notes were cross-referenced with the sexual health network (Sandyford). Identified issues included no documentation of implications of testing, poor communication of positive results and poor referral pathways to sexual health for assessment; all leading to inadequate management. A shared care network was created to address these issues. A designated sexual health advisor was identified to improve sexual health referral, specialist assessment, standardised management and contact tracing. Re-audit showed more consistent follow-up.",New PCR technology has resulted in a shared care approach to address corresponding implications of testing.

Is the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab a reasonable option?,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is characterized by proteinuria and other symptoms of the nephrotic syndrome. In many cases, the etiology is unknown. Whether and how to treat MN is still a controversial question. Despite the use of corticosteroids and alkylating agents, up to 40% of patients still progress to end-stage renal failure. A 40-year-old male patient with biopsy-proven idiopathic MN was initially treated with prednisolone and chlorambucil because of a proteinuria of 22 g/d. Treatment with cyclosporine was started because the nephrotic syndrome failed to improve. Proteinuria was reduced to a minimum of 4 g/d. Cyclosporine was stopped after 17 months leading to a fast relapse. Therapy with an ACE inhibitor and AT(1) receptor antagonist and retreatment with cyclosporine improved proteinuria. Cyclosporine was terminated after a total of 24 months. 5 months later, relapse occurred with a high proteinuria of 34 g/d. The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was given four times every 4 weeks. 4 weeks and 4 months after the end of treatment, proteinuria decreased to 780 mg/d and<150 mg/d, but renal function remained impaired (creatinine clearance 65 ml/min, stage 2 according to K/DOQI). Now, remission of proteinuria (<150 mg/d) has been stable for almost 2 years. However, renal insufficiency progressed further (creatinine clearance 45 ml/min, stage 3 according to K/DOQI).","Rituximab offers the possibility for a targeted treatment of idiopathic MN. Based on the existing evidence and experience from this case, rituximab can be recommended as a new treatment option for MN, possibly before starting any treatment with cytotoxic agents and high-dose prednisolone carrying the risk of severe side effects. However, long-term results of this treatment are still lacking.",closed_qa
Do chronic rhinosinusitis osteoblasts differ in cellular properties from normal bone?,"Osteitis, characterized by bony thickening and remodeling, is often considered a hallmark of recalcitrant rhinosinusitis. However, there is limited literature examining the bone in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) pathology. In this study we cultured osteoblasts from bone harvested during sinus surgery as well as from nondiseased controls to compare their cellular properties. Sinus bone was collected during sinus and skull-base surgery and placed in proliferation media. Outgrowth of cells occurred at 2 weeks and the cells were confirmed to be osteoblasts by alkaline phosphatase staining. Cellular adhesion was determined by replating and counting adhered cells at 4 hours. Proliferation of cells plated for 24 hours was assayed by measuring [(3) H]-thymidine incorporation. Calcium content was measured by changing cells to differentiation media and measuring the calcium content on days 7, 14, and 21. Alkaline phosphatase assay showed more than 90% of osteoblasts staining in all samples. Osteoblasts from patients with CRS had significant decreases in adhesion (p < 0.01) compared to osteoblasts from skull-base patients. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in calcium content in rhinosinusitis samples compared with the nondiseased sinus bone samples.","To date, this is the first known study that shows a direct comparison of osteoblast properties between patients with and without CRS. Our results indicate that there are fundamental phenotypic differences in adhesion and mineralization between osteoblasts in patients with CRS compared to controls.",closed_qa
"Is the 5-yr HAQ-disability related to the first year 's changes in the narrowing , rather than erosion score in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis?","To evaluate the predictive validity of radiological change on 5-yr disability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study was designed to be multicentre, prospective, longitudinal, with a 5-yr follow-up. Participants were RA patients (ACR criteria), with a disease duration of <1 yr at entry. Radiographs of the hands and feet in posteroanterior view at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up (van der Heijde's modification of Sharp method) were used for structural evaluation. Disability was evaluated with Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at yr 5. Analyses consisted of (i) correlation existing between the changes in the radiological scores during the first year and the HAQ value at yr 5 and (ii) determination of the optimal cut-off in the changes in the radiological scoring system, by ROC curve analysis, in which variable to be explained was disability status at yr 5, defined by HAQ value of at least 1. Due to missing data and/or lost to follow-up, 135 patients (out of the 191 recruited patients) were included in the analyses (mean change in the radiological score = 4.9 +/- 8.7 points, mean HAQ at yr 5 = 0.62 +/- 0.68). There was a statistically significant correlation between the HAQ-disability status at yr 5 and the changes observed in the radiological total damage and narrowing scores during the first year (r = 0.18, P = 0.046 and r = 0.25, P = 0.006, respectively). Conversely, the short-term changes in the erosion score were not correlated with subsequent HAQ-disability (r = 0.084, P = 0.36). A change of at least 2 points in the total X-ray score was considered as optimal (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 66.7, 53.9, 32.8 and 82.8%, respectively).","This work shows that early changes in joint damage in patients with recent-onset RA are related to subsequent HAQ-disability. This relationship is due to changes in narrowing, rather than in erosion score, suggesting that the joint narrowing score might be of great importance in the follow-up of RA patients and in the reports of scientific results. The weak performance of the thresholds established using predictive validity for subsequent HAQ-disability compromise their use at the individual level.",closed_qa
Determination of maximal lactate steady state in healthy adults: can NIRS help?,"We tested the hypothesis that the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) can be accurately determined in healthy subjects based on measures of deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb), an index of oxygen extraction measured noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Thirty-two healthy men (mean ± SD age = 48 ± 17 yr, range = 23-74 yr) performed an incremental cycling test to exhaustion and square wave tests for MLSS determination. Cardiorespiratory variables were measured bbb and deoxyHb was monitored noninvasively on the right vastus lateralis with a quantitative NIRS device. The individual values of V˙O2 and HR corresponding to the MLSS were calculated and compared to the NIRS-derived MLSS (NIRSMLSS) that was, in turn, determined by double linear function fitting of deoxyHb during the incremental exercise. V˙O2 and HR at MLSS were 2.25 ± 0.54 L·min (76% ± 9% V˙O2max) and 133 ± 14 bpm (81% ± 7% HRmax), respectively. Muscle O2 extraction increased as a function of exercise intensity up to a deflection point, NIRSMLSS, at which V˙O2 and HR were 2.23 ± 0.59 L·min (76% ± 9% V˙O2max) and 136 ± 17 bpm (82% ± 8% HRmax), respectively. For both V˙O2 and HR, the difference of NIRSMLSS from MLSS values was not significant and the measures were highly correlated (r = 0.81 and r = 0.76). The Bland-Altman analysis confirmed a nonsignificant bias for V˙O2 and HR (-0.015 L·min and 3 bpm, respectively) and a small imprecision of 0.26 L·min and 8 bpm.","A plateau in muscle O2 extraction was demonstrated in coincidence with MLSS during an incremental cycling exercise, confirming the hypothesis that this functional parameter can be accurately estimated with a quantitative NIRS device. The main advantages of NIRSMLSS over lactate-based techniques are the noninvasiveness and the time/cost efficiency.",closed_qa
Accuracy of the diagnosis of fibromyalgia by family physicians: is the pendulum shifting?,"We evaluated the accuracy of diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM) by family physicians. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 646 consecutive patients newly referred to the outpatient rheumatology clinic of Soroka University Medical Center from January 1, 2005, until December 31, 2007. The kappa statistic was used to measure agreement between family-physician and rheumatologist diagnoses for FM in the total patient cohort as well as in groups stratified by ethnicity. Sensitivity and specificity of family-physician diagnosis of FM were calculated using rheumatologist diagnosis as the gold standard. There were no exclusion criteria. During the time period of the study, 646 new patients were seen in the rheumatology clinic. Of 196 patients referred with an initial diagnosis of FM, the consultant rheumatologist confirmed this diagnosis in 71% of cases. The overall kappa for FM diagnosis between family physicians and rheumatologists was 0.70 (p<0.001), indicating a good level of agreement. Agreement was substantially lower among Bedouin patients (kappa=0.35, p=0.003). All other patients in our study were Jewish Israelis. Using rheumatologist diagnosis as the gold standard, overall sensitivity and specificity of FM diagnosis by family physicians were 87.4% and 88.3%, respectively.",Family physicians in our region are able to accurately diagnose FM. Future studies might focus on evaluating the factors and biases accounting for differences in level of diagnostic accuracy for FM among various ethnic groups.,closed_qa
Does increased energy expenditure associated with repetitive involuntary movement contribute to growth failure in girls with Rett syndrome?,"To determine whether increased total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) associated with repetitive, involuntary movements contributes to growth failure in girls with Rett syndrome (RS). Fourteen girls with RS and 11 healthy girls were studied for 10 days to obtain measurements of height, weight, body circumference, and skin-fold thickness with stadiometric and anthropometric methods; whole-body potassium by potassium 40 counting; 72-hour dietary energy intakes by test weighing; 24-hour activity patterns using observational methods; and TDEE using the doubly-labeled water technique. TDEE, when adjusted for differences in lean body mass, did not differ significantly between girls with RS and healthy girls. Although girls with RS spent more waking hours in physical activity than their healthy counterparts (85%+/-10% vs. 73%+/-11% awake time per day, p < 0.05), their repetitive movements were not sufficiently intense to increase TDEE. However, girls with RS had significantly less lean body mass, but not body fat, which contributed to their lower absolute TDEE in comparison with that of healthy girls (845+/-251 vs. 1453+/-534 kcal/day, p < 0.01). Dietary energy intake, when adjusted for differences in body weight, was not significantly different in girls with RS compared with healthy girls.","Increased TDEE as a result of repetitive, involuntary movements does not explain the alterations in growth and body composition of girls with RS.",closed_qa
Does mechanical Stretching promote Skin Tissue Regeneration via Enhancing Mesenchymal Stem Cell Homing and Transdifferentiation?,"Skin tissue expansion is a clinical procedure for skin regeneration to reconstruct cutaneous defects that can be accompanied by severe complications. The transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been proven effective in promoting skin expansion and helping to ameliorate complications; however, systematic understanding of its mechanism remains unclear. MSCs from luciferase-Tg Lewis rats were intravenously transplanted into a rat tissue expansion model to identify homing and transdifferentiation. To clarify underlying mechanisms, a systematic approach was used to identify the differentially expressed genes between mechanically stretched human MSCs and controls. The biological significance of these changes was analyzed through bioinformatic methods. We further investigated genes and pathways of interest to disclose their potential role in mechanical stretching-induced skin regeneration. Cross sections of skin samples from the expanded group showed significantly more luciferase(+) and stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α)(+), luciferase(+)keratin 14(+), and luciferase(+)CD31(+) cells than the control group, indicating MSC transdifferentiation into epidermal basal cells and endothelial cells after SDF-1α-mediated homing. Microarray analysis suggested upregulation of genes related to hypoxia, vascularization, and cell proliferation in the stretched human MSCs. Further investigation showed that the homing of MSCs was blocked by short interfering RNA targeted against matrix metalloproteinase 2, and that mechanical stretching-induced vascular endothelial growth factor A upregulation was related to the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) and Wnt signaling pathways. This study determines that mechanical stretching might promote skin regeneration by upregulating MSC expression of genes related to hypoxia, vascularization, and cell proliferation; enhancing transplanted MSC homing to the expanded skin; and transdifferentiation into epidermal basal cells and endothelial cells.","Skin tissue expansion is a clinical procedure for skin regeneration to cover cutaneous defects that can be accompanied by severe complications.

Does femoral artery ligation stimulate capillary growth and limits training-induced increases in oxidative capacity in rats?,"The purpose of this study was to assess the interaction of arterial insufficiency and exercise training on soleus and plantaris muscle capillarity and oxidative capacity in adult rats. Arterial insufficiency was created by ligation (LIG) of the right femoral artery, and exercise training (TR) was performed on a rodent treadmill. The left hindlimb served as a normally (NORM) perfused control. Capillary:fiber ratio number of capillary contacts per fiber, and citrate synthase activity (CS) were evaluated in the plantaris (Plant) and soleus (Sol) muscles. In sedentary rats, CS was similar between LIG and NORM (Plant: 24.4 vs. 24.3 mumol.min-1.g-1; Sol: 16.6 vs. 16.9 mumol.min-1.g-1), but capillaries per fiber and capillary contacts per fiber were significantly elevated in the plantaris muscle of LIG (2.46 vs. 2.10 caps/fiber, 5.78 vs. 5.03 capillary contacts). CS was elevated in both limbs of TR but was lower in LIG than in NORM (Plant: 28.5 vs. 32.4 mumol.min-1.g-1; Sol: 21.1 vs. 24.9 mumol.min-1.g-1). Treadmill training did not significantly affect capillarity in NORM. However, muscles in the ligated limb of TR tended to have greater capillarity than comparable muscles in either NORM of TR of LIG in SED.","These results demonstrate capillary proliferation in the plantaris but not soleus muscle of rat hindlimbs with femoral artery ligation. Capillarity and CS adaptations were not obligatorily related in LIG, and femoral artery ligation and exercise training appeared to have interactive effects on skeletal muscle capillarity.",closed_qa
Does music therapy increase serum melatonin levels in patients with Alzheimer 's disease?,"Music therapy is known to have healing and relaxing effects. Although these effects appear to be mediated by release of neurotransmitters and neurohormones, the specific neurohormonal systems involved have not been fully investigated. To assess the effects of a music therapy intervention on concentrations of melatonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and prolactin in the blood of a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Blood samples were obtained before initiating the therapy, immediately at the end of 4 weeks of music therapy sessions, and at 6 weeks follow-up after cessation of the sessions. Miami Veterans Administration Medical Center, Miami, Fla. 20 male inpatients with Alzheimer's disease. 30- to 40-minute morning sessions of music therapy 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Changes in melatonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and prolactin following music therapy. Melatonin concentration in serum increased significantly after music therapy and was found to increase further at 6 weeks follow-up. A significant increase was found between baseline values and data recorded after the music therapy sessions as well as at 6 weeks follow-up. Norepinephrine and epinephrine levels increased significantly after 4 weeks of music therapy, but returned to pretherapy levels at 6 weeks follow-up. Serum concentration of prolactin and platelet serotonin levels remained unchanged after 4 weeks of music therapy and at 6 weeks follow-up.",Increased levels of melatonin following music therapy may have contributed to patients' relaxed and calm mood.,closed_qa
Is suicidality associated with medication access problems in publicly insured psychiatric patients?,"Beginning January 1, 2006, the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit shifted drug coverage from Medicaid to the new Medicare Part D program for patients who were eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid benefits (""dual-eligibles""). These patients were randomly assigned to a private Part D plan and came under specific formulary and utilization management procedures of the plan in which they were enrolled. To examine the relationship between physician-reported medication switches, discontinuations, and other access problems and suicidal ideation or behavior among ""dual-eligible"" psychiatric patients. Data were collected in 3 cross-sectional cycles in 2006 (January-April, May-August, and September-December) as part of the National Study of Medicaid and Medicare Psychopharmacologic Treatment Access and Continuity using through-the-mail, practice-based survey research methods. Data from the third cycle, representing all events since January 1, 2006, were used for these analyses. A national sample of psychiatrists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile provided clinically detailed data on 1 systematically selected, dual-eligible psychiatric patient (N = 908). Propensity score analyses adjusted for patient sociodemographics, treatment setting, diagnoses, and psychiatric symptom severity. Patients who experienced medication switches, discontinuations, and other access problems had 3 times the rate of suicidal ideation or behavior compared with patients with no access problems (22.0% vs 7.4%, P < .0001). Mean odds ratios and excess probabilities were highest for patients who were clinically stable but were required to switch medications (31.8%; mean OR = 4.87, mean P = 8.92(-5), excess probability = 0.21). Patients who experienced discontinuations (26.4%; mean OR = 2.13, mean P = 2.12(-2), excess probability = 0.12), other access problems (18.7%; mean OR = 3.01, mean P = 1.03(-5), excess probability = 0.15), and multiple access problems (22.3%; mean OR = 2.88, mean P = 4.10(-5), excess probability = 0.14) also had significantly increased suicidal ideation or behavior.","Increased occurrences of suicidal ideation or behavior appear to be associated with disruptions in patient medication access and continuity.

Does simvastatin inhibit oxidative stress via the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling in trophoblast cells?,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcriptional regulator against oxidative stress through the induction of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), glutamyl cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC), and glutamyl cysteine ligase modulatory (GCLM). Nrf2 signaling is disrupted in pre-eclamptic placentas, although increased oxidative stress is implicated in pre-eclampsia. The aims of the study were: (i) to investigate the mechanism that underlies the impaired Nrf2 signaling in pre-eclamptic placentas, and (ii) to examine the potential therapeutic role of statin for pre-eclampsia. Human choriocarcinoma JAR cells were cultured under normoxia (20% O2 ) or hypoxia (1% O2 ). Small-interfering ribonucleic acids were used to knockdown Nrf2. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to evaluate the influence of oxidative stress (H2O2 100 μM) and simvastatin (50 μM) on Nrf2 and its target genes. Reactive oxygen species levels were analyzed by flow cytometry in immortalized human trophoblast TCL1 cells treated with or without H2O2 (100 μM) ± simvastatin (50 μM). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 activation was significantly suppressed under hypoxic conditions. Nrf2 knockdown resulted in insufficient enhancement of HO-1, GCLC and GCLM expression under oxidative stress. In contrast, Nrf2 signaling was augmented by simvastatin, which suppressed the induction of oxidative stress in trophoblasts.","Hypoxia is one of the important negative regulators of Nrf2 activation, and simvastatin inhibits oxidative stress through the activation of Nrf2 signaling in trophoblasts, indicating the potential therapeutic role of statin for pre-eclampsia.",closed_qa
Is minimally invasive parathyroidectomy without QPTH monitoring justified?,"It is matter of discussion if quick parathyroid hormone (QPTH) monitoring is helpful in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and ""localized single-gland disease"" (SGD; concordant sestamibi and ultrasound results) to further increase the rate of success (permanent normocalcemia) of performing selective parathyroidectomy by minimally invasive parathyroid exploration (MIP). The aim of this study was to evaluate if a randomized controlled trial was justified in order to clarify this discussion. The prospective database of patients with sporadic PHPT, SGD, MIP, and QPTH monitoring (1999-2005) was evaluated regarding the ""conversion rate"" to bilateral exploration and permanent normocalcemia (""QPTH"" group). Retrospectively, the patients were analyzed a second time ""without"" applying QPTH monitoring (""non-QPTH"" group). Statistical differences between both groups were calculated (McNemar's test). By definition, 338 patients with ""localized SGD"" underwent MIP. MIP was finished in 308 (91.1%) patients. Five of 308 patients (1.6%) showed persisting (n = 1) or recurrent disease (n = 4). In 30 of 338 patients (8.9%), a conversion to bilateral exploration was necessary (false preoperative localization 15 patients--one patient not cured; multiple-gland disease correctly indicated by QPTH monitoring 15 patients--one patient not cured). Analyzing the ""non-QPTH"" group, 14 additional patients showed persisting disease. Thus, without using QPTH monitoring, the rate of persisting PHPT would increase from 0.9% (three patients) to 5.0% (17 patients; p = 0.0005).","Intraoperative QPTH assay seems necessary even in patients with ""localized SGD"" by two techniques in an endemic goiter region.

Outcomes relating to urinary retention and suprapubic tube placement were analyzed in three groups: those with 3.5 cm cuff placement, ≥ 4 cm cuff placement, and transcorporal cuff (TC) placement of any size. Among 139 patients who underwent AUS placement from 2007-2010, 117 cases met inclusion criteria - 42 men received a 3.5 cm cuff, 53 received a ≥ 4 cm cuff, and 22 received a TC cuff (all ≥ 4 cm). TC patients had a significantly higher rate of urinary retention compared to the ≥ 4 cm group [7/22 (32%) versus 4/53 (8%), p = 0.02] as well as a higher rate of SPT placement [6/22 (27%) versus 1/53 (2%), p = 0.007].",Transcorporal cuff placement is associated with a significantly higher rate of urinary retention and suprapubic tube placement compared to traditional 4 cm cuff placement.,closed_qa

Do stimulation parameters define the effectiveness of burst spinal cord stimulation in a rat model of neuropathic pain?,"Although burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been reported to reduce neuropathic pain, no study has explicitly investigated how the different parameters that define burst SCS may modulate its efficacy. The effectiveness of burst SCS to reduce neuronal responses to noxious stimuli by altering stimulation parameters was evaluated in a rat model of cervical radiculopathy. Neuronal firing was recorded in the spinal dorsal horn before and after burst SCS on day 7 following painful cervical nerve root compression (N = 8 rats). The parameters defining the stimulation (number of pulses per burst, pulse frequency, pulse width, burst frequency, amplitude) were individually varied in separate stimulation trials while holding the remaining parameters constant. The percent reduction of firing of wide-dynamic-range (WDR) and high-threshold neurons after SCS and the percentage of neurons responding to SCS were quantified for each parameter and correlated to the charge per burst delivered during stimulation. Pulse number, pulse width, and amplitude each were significantly correlated (p <0.009) to suppression of neuronal firing after SCS. Pulse frequency and amplitude significantly affected (p <0.05) the percentage of responsive neurons. Charge per burst was correlated to a reduction of WDR neuronal firing (p <0.03) and had a nonlinear effect on the percentage of neurons responding to burst SCS.",Burst SCS can be optimized by adjusting relevant stimulation parameters to modulate the charge delivered to the spinal cord during stimulation. The efficacy of burst SCS is dependent on the charge per burst.,closed_qa
Measures pneumonia quality associated with antibiotics for congestive heart failure patients?,"Pneumonia antibiotic timing performance measures can result in unnecessary antibiotic administration to patients in whom a diagnosis of pneumonia remains possible but has not been confirmed. Our objective was to determine if unnecessary antibiotic administration to admissions with Emergency Department (ED) congestive heart failure (CHF) diagnoses increased as institutional attention to pneumonia antibiotic timing intensified. We performed a cross-sectional study in an academic ED with 39,000 annual visits. Our subjects included adult admissions with ED CHF diagnoses between October and March of 2004-2005, 2005-2006, and 2006-2007. We excluded patients with any concomitant infectious diagnosis from primary analysis. We obtained patient age, sex, triage acuity, vital signs, ED diagnoses, and admitting service from electronic databases. Trained abstractors confirmed infectious diagnosis presence and noted if antibiotics were administered. Inter-observer agreement was assessed. Multivariate logistic regression determined association of time period with antibiotic administration. We assessed trends in concomitant infectious diagnoses. Of 778 CHF admissions, 125 had infectious diagnoses, leaving 653 for primary analysis. Inter-observer agreement was good to excellent (κ = 0.71-0.83). Demographic and presenting characteristics did not vary by period. Antibiotics were administered to 18.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.7-23.3), 15.0% (95% CI 9.6-18.5), and 15.1% (95% CI 10.2-19.8), per period, respectively.

Does hIV protease inhibitor ritonavir induce cytotoxicity of human endothelial cells?,"Although HIV protease inhibitors have been successfully used against HIV infection, many metabolic side effects and premature cardiovascular diseases are often associated with this therapy. The mechanisms of these complications are not clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir on human endothelial cell cultures. By using nonradioactive cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays, human endothelial cells treated with ritonavir showed a significant decrease in cell viability and an increase in cytotoxicity in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Mitochondrial DNA was also substantially damaged with ritonavir treatment by long polymerase chain reaction analysis. In contrast, ritonavir had a very limited effect on endothelial apoptosis, as assessed by analyses of DNA fragmentation and cellular caspase-3 activity.","These data demonstrate, for the first time, that the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir at concentrations near clinical plasma levels is able to directly cause endothelial mitochondrial DNA damage and cell death mainly through necrosis pathways but not through apoptosis.

Substance-use problems: are uninsured workers at greater risk?,"This study examined how problem drinking and drug use and their related treatment received by workers varied by health insurance coverage and employment characteristics. We used National Survey on Drug Use and Health data on civilian workers ages 18 years and older from the 2002 and 2003 public-use files. Multivariate logistic regressions estimated the relationship between workers' uninsured status and problem use, dependence, and treatment while controlling for worker demographics, education, income, and job characteristics. Controlling for differences in worker and workplace characteristics, uninsured workers were significantly more likely than privately insured workers to be illicit drug users or heavy drinkers. Among dependent workers, the lack of insurance was associated with a reduction in treatment received for problem drinkers (odds ratio = 0.31, p = .13). By contrast, a large, positive-albeit statistically nonsignificant-association between being uninsured and receiving treatment prevailed among uninsured workers using illicit drugs. Workplace substance-use policies were associated with a significant reduction in the odds of treatment received or treatment needed among problem drinkers without insurance coverage. Employee assistance programs were not good predictors of treatment received among uninsured workers.","Uninsured workers were more likely to be heavy drinkers or illicit drug users than were workers with health insurance. Health insurance coverage was not significantly associated with treatment received among workers reporting problem use.

Is intrapartum intravenous zidovudine for prevention of mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission still useful in the combination antiretroviral therapy era?,"Intrapartum intravenous zidovudine (ZDV) prophylaxis is a long-standing component of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in high-resource countries. In some recent guidelines, intravenous ZDV is no longer systematically recommended for mothers receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with low viral load. We evaluated the impact of intravenous ZDV according to viral load and obstetrical conditions. All HIV-1-infected women delivering between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2010 in the French Perinatal Cohort (ANRS-EPF) were analyzed if they received ART during pregnancy and did not breastfeed. We identified maternal and obstetrical characteristics related to lack of intravenous ZDV and compared its association with MTCT rate and other infant parameters, according to various risk factors. Intravenous ZDV was used in 95.2% of the 11 538 deliveries. Older age, multiparity, and preterm and vaginal delivery were associated with lack of intravenous ZDV (n = 554). In women who delivered with viral load ≥1000 copies/mL, the overall MTCT rate was higher without than with intravenous ZDV (7.5% vs 2.9%; P = .01); however, there was no such difference when the neonate received postnatal intensification therapy. Among them, 77% of women who had viral load<400 copies/mL, there was no difference in MTCT rate (0% without intravenous ZDV vs 0.6% with intravenous ZDV; P = .17). Intravenous ZDV was not associated with increased short-term hematological toxicity or lactate level.","Intravenous ZDV remains an effective tool to reduce transmission in cases of virological failure, even in cART-treated women. However, for the vast majority of women with low viral loads at delivery, in the absence of obstetrical risk factors, systematic intravenous ZDV appears to be unnecessary.",closed_qa
Is excess risk of renal allograft loss and early mortality among elderly recipients associated with poor exercise capacity?,"Successful renal transplantation in the elderly offers substantial benefits in quality and life expectancy.

We identified potential risk factors that may predict clinical outcomes in older transplant recipients. A log-rank test and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of various patient characteristics on graft and patient survival. Among older patients, graft survival was 76.6% and 67% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. When graft survival was censored for death with functioning graft, the 1- and 3-year graft survival was 83% and 82%, respectively. Patient survival was 78% and 71% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. These survival rates were significantly lower than those of younger recipients. Pretransplant inactivity, delayed graft function, smoking history and longer waiting time predicted poor graft and patient survival. A history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral vascular disease also predicted a higher mortality among older recipients.","Older kidney transplant recipients are at high risk for allograft failure and early death. Poor functional capacity predicts a poor outcome for older patients undergoing renal transplantation. Therefore, careful patient selection is paramount, and every effort should be made to initiate timely interventions aimed at increasing physical activity in those with low fitness level.",closed_qa
Does free fatty acid depletion acutely decrease cardiac work and efficiency in cardiomyopathic heart failure?,"Metabolic modulators that enhance myocardial glucose metabolism by inhibiting free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism may improve cardiac function in heart failure patients. We studied the effect of acute FFA withdrawal on cardiac function in patients with heart failure caused by idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). Eighteen fasting nondiabetic patients with IDCM (14 men, 4 women, aged 58.8+/-8.0 years, ejection fraction 33+/-8.8%) and 8 matched healthy controls underwent examination of myocardial perfusion and oxidative and FFA metabolism, before and after acute reduction of serum FFA concentrations by acipimox, an inhibitor of lipolysis. Metabolism was monitored by positron emission tomography and [15O]H2O, [11C]acetate, and [11C]palmitate. Left ventricular function and myocardial work were echocardiographically measured, and efficiency of forward work was calculated. Acipimox decreased myocardial FFA uptake by >80% in both groups. Rate-pressure product and myocardial perfusion remained unchanged, whereas stroke volume decreased similarly in both groups. In the healthy controls, reduced cardiac work was accompanied by decreased oxidative metabolism (from 0.071+/-0.019 to 0.055+/-0.016 min(-1), P<0.01). In IDCM patients, cardiac work fell, whereas oxidative metabolism remained unchanged and efficiency fell (from 35.4+/-12.6 to 31.6+/-13.3 mm Hg x L x g(-1), P<0.05).","Acutely decreased serum FFA depresses cardiac work. In healthy hearts, this is accompanied by parallel decrease in oxidative metabolism, and myocardial efficiency is preserved. In failing hearts, FFA depletion did not downregulate oxidative metabolism, and myocardial efficiency deteriorated. Thus, failing hearts are unexpectedly more dependent than healthy hearts on FFA availability. We propose that both glucose and fatty acid oxidation are required for optimal function of the failing heart.",closed_qa
Does hypoxia transiently sequester mps1 and polo to collagenase-sensitive filaments in Drosophila prometaphase oocytes?,"The protein kinases Mps1 and Polo, which are required for proper cell cycle regulation in meiosis and mitosis, localize to numerous ooplasmic filaments during prometaphase in Drosophila oocytes. These filaments first appear throughout the oocyte at the end of prophase and are disassembled after egg activation. We showed here that Mps1 and Polo proteins undergo dynamic and reversible localization to static ooplasmic filaments as part of an oocyte-specific response to hypoxia. The observation that Mps1- and Polo-associated filaments reappear in the same locations through multiple cycles of oxygen deprivation demonstrates that underlying structural components of the filaments must still be present during normoxic conditions. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we observed triple-helical binding of Mps1 to numerous electron-dense filaments, with the gold label wrapped around the outside of the filaments like a garland. In addition, we showed that in live oocytes the relocalization of Mps1 and Polo to filaments is sensitive to injection of collagenase, suggesting that the structural components of the filaments are composed of collagen-like fibrils. However, the collagen-like genes we have been able to test so far (vkg and CG42453) did not appear to be associated with the filaments, demonstrating that the collagenase-sensitive component of the filaments is one of a number of other Drosophila proteins bearing a collagenase cleavage site. Finally, as hypoxia is known to cause Mps1 protein to accumulate at kinetochores in syncytial embryos, we also show that GFP-Polo accumulates at both kinetochores and centrosomes in hypoxic syncytial embryos.",These findings identify both a novel cellular structure (the ooplasmic filaments) as well as a new localization pattern for Mps1 and Polo and demonstrate that hypoxia affects Polo localization in Drosophila.,closed_qa
Does resistance training reduce the blood pressure response of older men during submaximum aerobic exercise?,"The objective of this study was to determine whether 16 weeks of resistance training (RT) can reduce the blood pressure response and improve the cardiovascular function of men aged 70-80 years during submaximum aerobic exercise. Twenty-four men aged between 70 and 80 years were randomly assigned to an RT group (n = 12) and control group (n = 12). Training consisted of three sets of six to 10 repetitions at 70-90% of one repetition maximum, three times per week, on an incline squat machine for 16 weeks. Blood pressure and cardiovascular function were assessed during submaximum cycle exercise at 40 W, and 50 and 70% of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) before training and after 16 weeks of training. Leg strength and VO2max were assessed every 4 weeks of the 16-week study. At 40 W, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and rate pressure product were lower and stroke volume was significantly higher after 16 weeks of training. At 50% VO2max, heart rate and rate pressure product were lower after 16 weeks of training and at 70% VO2max, cycle ergometry power, VO2, and arterio-venous oxygen difference were higher after 16 weeks of training. Leg strength significantly increased after 16 weeks of training.","Sixteen weeks of RT significantly reduces the blood pressure response and improves the cardiovascular function of older men during submaximum aerobic exercise. Therefore, RT not only increases muscular strength and hypertrophy but also provides significant cardiovascular benefits for older individuals.",closed_qa
Can inhA mutation predict ethionamide resistance?,"A tertiary care centre in Mumbai, India. To estimate the extent of association between inhA mutant isoniazid (INH) resistant strains and ethionamide (ETH) resistance.

Does inhibition of Pyk2 block lung inflammation and injury in a mouse model of acute lung injury?,"Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is essential in neutrophil degranulation and chemotaxis in vitro. However, its effect on the process of lung inflammation and edema formation during LPS induced acute lung injury (ALI) remains unknown. The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of inhibiting Pyk2 on LPS-induced acute lung inflammation and injury in vivo. C57BL6 mice were given either 10 mg/kg LPS or saline intratracheally. Inhibition of Pyk2 was effected by intraperitoneal administration TAT-Pyk2-CT 1 h before challenge. Bronchoalveolar lavage analysis of cell counts, lung histology and protein concentration in BAL were analyzed at 18 h after LPS treatment. KC and MIP-2 concentrations in BAL were measured by a mouse cytokine multiplex kit. The static lung compliance was determined by pressure-volume curve using a computer-controlled small animal ventilator. The extravasated Evans blue concentration in lung homogenate was determined spectrophotometrically. Intratracheal instillation of LPS induced significant neutrophil infiltration into the lung interstitium and alveolar space, which was attenuated by pre-treatment with TAT-Pyk2-CT. TAT-Pyk2-CT pretreatment also attenuated 1) myeloperoxidase content in lung tissues, 2) vascular leakage as measured by Evans blue dye extravasation in the lungs and the increase in protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage, and 3) the decrease in lung compliance. In each paradigm, treatment with control protein TAT-GFP had no blocking effect. By contrast, production of neutrophil chemokines MIP-2 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine in the bronchoalveolar lavage was not reduced by TAT-Pyk2-CT. Western blot analysis confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in LPS-challenged lungs was reduced to control levels by TAT-Pyk2-CT pretreatment.",These results suggest that Pyk2 plays an important role in the development of acute lung injury in mice and that pharmacological inhibition of Pyk2 might provide a potential therapeutic strategy in the pretreatment for patients at imminent risk of developing acute lung injury.,closed_qa
Does endothelial cell activation contribute to the release of procoagulant microparticles during acute cardiac allograft rejection?,"Circulating procoagulant microparticles are reliable markers of vascular damage. The microparticle phenotypes provide additional information reflecting the nature of cell injury. This study assessed procoagulant microparticle levels and phenotypes in the diagnosis of acute allograft rejection after heart transplantation. Microparticles were prospectively investigated in the venous blood of 64 heart transplant patients, 23 with allograft rejection mainly of low score, and 41 without a rejection episode. Plasma concentrations of cytokines, cytoadhesins, and platelet activation markers were determined. By univariate analysis, the mean time elapsed from heart transplant, cold ischemia time, E-selectin-, Fas- and tissue factor-bearing microparticles were associated with allograft rejection. By multivariate analysis, E-selectin-microparticle levels appeared independently associated with allograft rejection, even when other significant variables were included in the model (odds ratio, 9.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-71.4; p = 0.023).",The pattern of procoagulant microparticles released during acute allograft rejection suggests endothelial cell activation and Fas-mediated apoptosis.

Is migraine with aura a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease : a critically appraised topic?,"To determine whether migraine with aura and migraine without aura are independent risk factors for symptomatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. We addressed the objective through development of a structured critically appraised topic that included a clinical scenario, structured question, search strategy, critical appraisal, results, summary of best evidence, commentary, and bottom-line conclusions. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, clinical epidemiologists, medical librarians, and clinical content experts. A prospective cohort study of 27,840 participants in the Women's Health Study determined that, compared with women lacking a migraine history, women who reported active migraine with aura had adjusted hazard ratios of 2.15 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-2.92) for major cardiovascular disease, 1.91 (95% CI, 1.17-3.10) for ischemic stroke, 1.74 (95% CI, 1.23-2.46) for coronary revascularization, 1.71 (95% CI, 1.16-2.53) for angina, and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.21-4.51) for ischemic cardiovascular disease death. Active migraine without aura was not associated with increased risk of any of the vascular event categories.","In women, active migraine with aura increases the risk of major CVD and ischemic stroke by approximately 2-fold compared with women without migraine. Active migraine without aura was not a risk factor for major CVD and stroke outcomes in this study. Additional emphasis on identification and treatment of modifiable vascular disease risk factors for women with active migraine with aura is warranted.",closed_qa
Does interleukin-1 receptor antagonist intervene in signaling between different types of synoviocytes in rats with adjuvant arthritis?,"To investigate the mechanisms of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the treatment of adjuvant arthritis (AA). AA was induced in rats by treatment with Freunds complete adjuvant (FCA). Rats were given an intracutaneous injection of IL-1ra (2.5, 10, 40 mg/kg, 3 times per day) from d 14 to d 21 after immunization. Synoviocyte proliferation and the activity of IL-1 were determined by using MTT assay. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. The ultrastructure of synoviocytes was observed by using a transmission electron microscope. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular regulating kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase were detected by Western blot analysis. IL-1ra (10 and 40 mg/kg, ic, d 14-21) modulated the secondary inflammatory reaction (P < 0.01), ultrastructure of synoviocytes and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in AA rats. The administration of IL-1ra (10 and 40 mg/kg, ic, d 14-21) in AA rats significantly decreased the production of IL-1, PGE2 and TNF-alpha by macrophage-like synoviocytes (MLS) (P < 0.01). IL-1ra (2.5 mg/kg) also decreased the production of PGE2 (P < 0.01) and TNF-alpha (P < 0.05) by MLS in AA rats. The increased phosphorylation of MAPK and cell proliferation in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) stimulated by supernatants of MLS in AA rats was also inhibited by IL-1ra (10 and 40 mg/kg, ic, d 14-21).","IL-1ra has anti-inflammatory effects because it modulates the ultrastructure of synoviocytes, decreases the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by MLS, and inhibits the phosphorylation of MAPK in FLS.",closed_qa
Does glucose level decline precede dementia in elderly African Americans with diabetes?,"High blood glucose levels may be responsible for the increased risk for dementia in diabetic patients. A secondary data analysis merging electronic medical records (EMRs) with data collected from the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia project (IIDP). Of the enrolled 4105 African Americans, 3778 were identified in the EMR. Study endpoints were dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal cognition. Repeated serum glucose measurements were used as the outcome variables. Diabetic participants who developed incident dementia had a significant decrease in serum glucose levels in the years preceding the diagnosis compared to the participants with normal cognition (P = .0002). They also had significantly higher glucose levels up to 9 years before the dementia diagnosis (P = .0367).",High glucose levels followed by a decline occurring years before diagnosis in African American participants with diabetes may represent a powerful presymptomatic metabolic indicator of dementia.,closed_qa
Is low serum free testosterone a marker for high grade prostate cancer?,"The association of free and total testosterone with prostate cancer is incompletely understood. We investigated the relationship of serum free and total testosterone to the clinical and pathological characteristics of prostate cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 117 consecutive patients treated by 1 physician and diagnosed with prostate cancer at our medical center between 1994 and 1997. Low free and total testosterone levels were defined as 1.5 or less and 300 ng./dl., respectively. After evaluating all 117 patients we noted no correlation of free and total testosterone with prostate specific antigen, patient age, prostatic volume, percent of positive biopsies, biopsy Gleason score or clinical stage. However, in patients with low versus normal free testosterone there were an increased mean percent of biopsies that showed cancer (43% versus 22%, p = 0.013) and an increased incidence of a biopsy Gleason score of 8 or greater (7 of 64 versus 0 of 48, p = 0.025). Of the 117 patients 57 underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. In those with low versus normal free testosterone an increased mean percent of biopsies demonstrated cancer (47% versus 28%, p = 0.018). Pathological evaluation revealed stage pT2ab, pT2c, pT3 and pT4 disease, respectively, in 31%, 64%, 8% and 0% of patients with low and in 40%, 40.6%, 12.5% and 6.2% in those with normal free testosterone (p>0.05).","In our study patients with prostate cancer and low free testosterone had more extensive disease. In addition, all men with a biopsy Gleason score of 8 or greater had low serum free testosterone.

Does bezafibrate induce multidrug-resistance P-Glycoprotein 3 expression in cultured human hepatocytes and humanized livers of chimeric mice?,"A decreased function of multidrug-resistance 3 P-glycoprotein (MDR3), limiting the rate of biliary phospholipid secretion, predisposes individuals to cholestasis and/or cholangitis. Fibrates induce the expression of mdr2 (homolog of human MDR3) in rodents. To investigate the effects of bezafibrate (BF) on the expression levels of MDR3 in cultured human hepatocytes and human livers, the amount of protein and subcellular localization of MDR3 was assessed in HepG2 cells treated with BF and humanized livers of BF-treated chimeric mice. In HepG2 cells, while treatment with BF did not increase the protein levels of MDR3, the treatment caused a redistribution of MDR3 in the bile canaliculi. In humanized livers of chimeric mice, oral administration of BF induced a large increase in the protein amount of MDR3 and its redistribution in the bile canaliculi. Moreover, the modulatory effects of BF on key factors involved in hepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in human subjects were traced in the humanized livers of BF-treated chimeric mice.",BF causes an induction of MDR3 expression in human livers.

Does contralateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery increase the risk of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy?,"Controversy exists about whether occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is associated with a worse perioperative prognosis and outcome. A systematic review of electronic information sources was undertaken to identify studies comparing perioperative and early outcomes of CEA in patients with occluded and patent contralateral carotid arteries. The methodologic quality of selected studies was independently appraised by two reviewers. Fixed- and random-effects models were applied to synthesize outcome data. Our literature search located 46 articles eligible for inclusion in the review and analysis. The total population comprised 27,265 patients having undergone 28,846 CEAs (occluded contralateral artery group, 3120; patent contralateral artery group, 25,726). Patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery had increased incidence of stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-2.09), transient ischemic attack (OR, 1.57, 95% CI, 1.11-2.21), stroke/transient ischemic attack (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.21-1.90), and death (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.19-2.59) ≤30 days of treatment compared with those with a patent contralateral vessel. No difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction between the two groups was identified (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.73-2.89).",Patients undergoing CEA in the presence of an occluded contralateral carotid artery had increased perioperative and early postoperative risk.

Does increased electroencephalographic gamma activity reveal awakening from isoflurane anaesthesia in rats?,"Animal studies often require reliable measures for anaesthetic drug effects. Lately, EEG-based depth of anaesthesia estimation has been widely applied to rat models. This study investigated the reliability of different EEG spectral properties in revealing awakening from isoflurane anaesthesia in rats. Adult Wistar rats with previously implanted frontal epidural electrodes were anaesthetized using isoflurane. The anaesthesia was slowly lightened until awakening, as observed by the first spontaneous movement, after which anaesthesia was induced again by increasing the isoflurane concentration. EEG was recorded during the recovery and induction periods, and the spectrograms and 23 quantitative spectral parameters used in the depth of anaesthesia estimation were calculated from the signals. The awakening was accompanied by a decrease in EEG activity at frequencies below 25 Hz, while the activity at higher frequencies (25-150 Hz) was increased. Whereas the behaviour of parameters used to measure activity in the lower frequencies was subject to variability between animals, the increase in higher frequency activity was more consistent, resulting in a statistically significant change in the relative gamma power parameters at the moment of awakening.","The increase in frontal relative gamma activity, especially in the 50-150 Hz frequency band, seems to be the most reliable EEG indicator for the awakening of a rat from isoflurane anaesthesia. A number of other spectral measures can also be used to detect this event. However, the role of gamma frequencies in the performance of these parameters is crucial.",closed_qa
Is γ-Aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) signalling in human pancreatic islets altered in type 2 diabetes?,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a signalling molecule in the interstitial space in pancreatic islets. We examined the expression and function of the GABA signalling system components in human pancreatic islets from normoglycaemic and type 2 diabetic individuals. Expression of GABA signalling system components was studied by microarray, quantitative PCR analysis, immunohistochemistry and patch-clamp experiments on cells in intact islets. Hormone release was measured from intact islets. The GABA signalling system was compromised in islets from type 2 diabetic individuals, where the expression of the genes encoding the α1, α2, β2 and β3 GABA(A) channel subunits was downregulated. GABA originating within the islets evoked tonic currents in the cells. The currents were enhanced by pentobarbital and inhibited by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, SR95531. The effects of SR95531 on hormone release revealed that activation of GABA(A) channels (GABA(A) receptors) decreased both insulin and glucagon secretion. The GABA(B) receptor antagonist, CPG55845, increased insulin release in islets (16.7 mmol/l glucose) from normoglycaemic and type 2 diabetic individuals.",Interstitial GABA activates GABA(A) channels and GABA(B) receptors and effectively modulates hormone release in islets from type 2 diabetic and normoglycaemic individuals.,closed_qa
Does thermosensitive hydrogel as a Tgf-beta1 gene delivery vehicle enhance diabetic wound healing?,"To accelerate diabetic wound healing with TGF-beta1 gene delivery system using a thermosensitive hydrogel made of a triblock copolymer, PEG-PLGA-PEG. Two 7 x 7 mm full thickness excisional wounds were created in parallel at the back of each genetically diabetic mouse. The hydrogel containing plasmid TGF-beta1 was administered to the wound and formed an adhesive film in situ. Controls were either untreated or treated with the hydrogel without DNA. We used a commercial wound dressing, Humatrix, either with or without DNA, to compare the therapeutic effect with the thermosensitive hydrogel. We found that thermosensitive hydrogel alone is slightly beneficial for reepithealization at early stage of healing (day 1-5), but significantly accelerated repithelializaion, increased cell proliferation, and organized collagen were observed in the wound bed treated with thermosensitive hydrogel containing plasmid TGF-beta1. The accelerated reepithelialization was accompanied with enhanced collagen synthesis and more organized extracellular matrix deposition.

Does obesity increase the risk of failure of noninvasive prenatal screening regardless of gestational age?,"Noninvasive prenatal screening has become an increasingly prevalent choice for women who desire aneuploidy screening. Although the test characteristics are impressive, some women are at increased risk for noninvasive prenatal screen failure. The risk of test failure increases with maternal weight; thus, obese women may be at elevated risk for failure. This risk of failure may be mitigated by the addition of a paternal cheek swab and screening at a later gestational age. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association among obesity, gestational age, and paternal cheek swab in the prevention of screening failure. A retrospective cohort study was performed for women who were ≥35 years old at delivery who underwent screening at NorthShore University HealthSystem, Evanston, IL. Maternal weight, body mass index, gestational age, and a paternal cheek swab were evaluated in univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess the association with failed screening. Five hundred sixty-five women met inclusion criteria for our study. The mean body mass index was 25.9 ± 5.1 kg/m(2); 111 women (20%) were obese (body mass index, ≥30 kg/m(2)). Forty-four women (7.8%) had a failed screen. Obese women had a failure rate of 24.3% compared with 3.8% in nonobese women (P < .01). Gestational age was not associated with failure rate (mean ± standard deviation, 13 ± 3 weeks for both screen failure and nonfailure; P = .76). The addition of a paternal cheek swab reduced the failure rate from 10.2% in women with no swab to 3.8% in women with a swab (P < .01). In multivariable analysis, obesity and lack of a paternal cheek swab were independent predictors of screen failure (odds ratio, 9.75; 95% confidence interval, 4.85-19.61; P < .01; and odds ratio, 3.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-8.33; P < .01, respectively).","The addition of a paternal cheek swab significantly improved noninvasive prenatal screen success rates in obese women.

Does combination of pre-operative radiotherapy and surgery suppress local accumulation of collagen and TGF-beta1 in rats?,"The systemic and local tissue repair responses of radiation in combination with surgery are still unclear. We have studied the effect of fractionated pre-operative radiotherapy with or without subsequent laparotomy on collagen accumulation using a rodent model. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups (eight rats per group): 1) sham radiation and sham laparotomy (control); 2) sham radiation and laparotomy; 3) radiation and sham laparotomy; and 4) radiation followed by laparotomy. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) tubes were implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal wall in the radiotherapy field and on the back outside the radiotherapy field day 0. The abdomen (3 cm x 4 cm) was irradiated day 3 (10 Gy) and again day 7 (10 Gy). On day 10, implants were extirpated, laparotomy undertaken in groups 2 and 4 and new ePTFE tubes implanted subcutaneously. The second implants were extirpated on day 20. Implants were analyzed for hydroxyproline, total protein and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) levels. On day 10, hydroxyproline (P < 0.05) and TGF-beta1 (P < 0.001) were lower in ePTFE tubes in irradiated compared with non-irradiated rats. On day 20, the abdominal ePTFE hydroxyproline remained low (P < 0.001) in animals subjected to laparotomy and pre-operative irradiation while hydroxyproline levels of rats subjected to irradiation only were similar to controls. The effects of radiation on hydroxyproline were confined to the irradiated abdominal area. There was a positive correlation between hydroxyproline and TGF-beta1 levels in the abdominal wall implant day 20 (r = 0.53, P < 0.005).","A clinically relevant fractionated radiation scheme reduced subcutaneous collagen accumulation pre-operatively and profoundly within the radiation field post-operatively after laparotomy, possibly because of lowered TGF-beta1 levels.",closed_qa

Is mesothelioma response to carbon nanotubes associated with an early and selective accumulation of immunosuppressive monocytic cells?,"The asbestos-like toxicity of some engineered carbon nanotubes (CNT), notably their capacity to induce mesothelioma, is a serious cause of concern for public health. Here we show that carcinogenic CNT induce an early and sustained immunosuppressive response characterized by the accumulation of monocytic Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (M-MDSC) that counteract effective immune surveillance of tumor cells. Wistar rats and C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with carcinogenic multi-walled Mitsui-7 CNT (CNT-7) or crocidolite asbestos. Peritoneal mesothelioma development and immune cell accumulation were assessed until 12 months. Leukocyte sub-populations were identified by recording expression of CD11b/c and His48 by flow cytometry. The immunosuppressive activity on T lymphocytes of purified peritoneal leukocytes was assessed in a co-culture assay with activated spleen cells. We demonstrate that long and short mesotheliomagenic CNT-7 injected in the peritoneal cavity of rats induced, like asbestos, an early and selective accumulation of monocytic cells (CD11b/c(int) and His48(hi)) which possess the ability to suppress polyclonal activation of T lymphocytes and correspond to M-MDSC. Peritoneal M-MDSC persisted during the development of peritoneal mesothelioma in CNT-7-treated rats but were only transiently recruited after non-carcinogenic CNT (CNT-M, CNT-T) injection. Peritoneal M-MDSC did not accumulate in mice which are resistant to mesothelioma development.","Our data provide new insights into the initial pathogenic events induced by CNT, adding a new component to the adverse outcome pathway leading to mesothelioma development. The specificity of the M-MDSC response after carcinogenic CNT exposure highlights the interest of this response for detecting the ability of new nanomaterials to cause cancer.",closed_qa
Does irregularity of photoreceptor layer after successful macular hole surgery prevent visual acuity improvement?,"To investigate the association between a photoreceptor irregularity and visual acuity (VA) after macular hole (MH) surgery. Prospective observational case series. Twenty-four eyes with an idiopathic MH that resolved after vitreous surgery were examined by new optical coherence tomography (OCT 3000). The images were divided into regular photoreceptor, detected as a straight line above the retinal pigment epithelium reflex, and irregular, which cannot be detected by it. Regular images were observed in 12 eyes (80%) and irregular images in 3 eyes (20%) with good VA (>or=0.7). Regular images were seen in 3 eyes (33%) and irregular images in 6 eyes (67%) with poor VA (<0.7). The percentage of regular images in the group with good VA was significantly higher than that in the group with poor VA (P <.05).",A photoreceptor irregularity after MH surgery may prevent VA improvement.,closed_qa
Do angiotensin receptor blockers improve survival outcomes after radiofrequency ablation in hepatocarcinoma patients?,"Inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis seems to decrease hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after radical therapies; however, data on the adjuvant role of angiotensin II receptor 1 blockers (sartans) are still lacking. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether sartans delay time to recurrence and prolong overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after radiofrequency ablation. Data on 153 patients were reviewed. The study population was classified into three groups: 73 (47.8%) patients who received neither angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors nor sartans (group 1), 49 (32%) patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (group 2), and 31 (20.2%) patients treated with sartans (group 3). Survival outcomes were analysed by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared with log-rank test. In the whole study population, 85.6% of patients were in Child-Pugh A class and 89.6% in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer A stage. Median maximum tumor diameter was 30 mm (10-40) and alpha fetoprotein was 25 (1.1-2100) UI/mL. No differences in baseline characteristics among the three groups were reported. Median overall survival was 48 months (95% confidence interval: 31-58) in group 1, 72 months (49-89) in group 2, and 84 months (58-92) in group 3 (P = 0.02). Median time to recurrence was 26 (15-42), 44 (33-72), and 69 (44-74) months in the three groups, respectively (P = 0.02). Sartan therapy was a significant predictor of longer overall survival and delayed time to recurrence on multivariate analysis.",Sartans significantly improved overall survival and time to recurrence after radiofrequency ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.,closed_qa
Do rat hepatic lipocytes synthesize and secrete transin ( stromelysin ) in early primary culture?,"Hepatic lipocyte proliferation and activation are pivotal in liver fibrosis. Disruption of normal lipocyte-matrix interactions may contribute to this process. The synthesis of transin, which degrades normal liver matrix, by culture-activated hepatic lipocytes was investigated. Lipocytes were isolated by pronase/collagenase perfusion, density gradient centrifugation, and centrifugal elutriation. Transin messenger RNA in lipocytes was analyzed by Northern blotting. Transin activity was analyzed by zymography, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative [14C]beta-casein degradation assay. Transin messenger RNA was detected in early primary culture (3-5 days) but not in freshly isolated lipocytes or late primary culture. Zymography of lipocyte medium showed caseinolytic activity (relative molecular weight, 57 kilodaltons and 60 kilodaltons) inhibited by ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid but not thiol or serine protease inhibitors. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of transin in media and cells. Quantitative transin activity decreased progressively with increasing duration of primary lipocyte culture and myofibroblastic transformation.","Rat hepatic lipocytes express the transin gene and secrete its product during the early phase of lipocyte activation in primary culture. Because this enzyme degrades a wide spectrum of normal basement membrane proteins and activates progelatinase B and interstitial collagenase, it may have an important role in liver injury and fibrosis.",closed_qa
Are airborne refractory ceramic fibers similar to asbestos in their carcinogenicity?,"Animal studies on refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) have led to the suggestion that RCF might resemble asbestos in carcinogenicity. Human data are available to test this hypothesis. We compared the occurrence of lung cancer and mesothelioma in 605 men engaged in the manufacture of RCF and followed since 1987 to cancer rates that would have been anticipated if airborne RCF were carcinogenic to the same degree as are crocidolite, amosite or chrysotile asbestos. We integrated the results of workplace exposure monitoring with mortality follow-up using formulas presented by Hodgson and Darnton (2000) to estimate hypothesized risks under different asbestos scenarios. During 15,281 person-years of observation, there were 12 deaths from lung cancer. General population rates predicted 11.8 cases expected for an observed/expected (O/E) ratio of 1.0. Anticipated numbers of deaths from lung cancer under hypotheses of carcinogenicity similar to that of amphiboles and chrysotile were 62 and 17, allowing for rejection of amphibole-like effects (p<10(-5)) but not chrysotile-like carcinogenicity (p = 0.15). There were no cases of mesothelioma, as compared to 4.9 anticipated under a crocidolite-like hypothesis (p = 0.007 to reject), 1.0 for amosite (p = 0.38) and 0.05 for chrysotile (p = 0.95).",There was no increase in lung cancer or mesothelioma in these workers exposed to RCF. If the cohort had the same exposure to crocidolite asbestos the number of lung cancer and mesothelioma cases would have been significantly greater than observed. The data do not yet permit a similar conclusion with respect to chrysotile asbestos.,closed_qa
Back pain and disability after lumbar laminectomy: is there a relationship to muscle retraction?,"Preliminary studies have suggested that prolonged retraction of the paraspinal muscle during spinal surgery may produce ischemic damage. We report the continuous measurement of intramuscular pressure (IMP) during decompressive lumbar laminectomy and its relationship to subsequent back pain and disability. Twenty patients undergoing two-level decompressive lumbar laminectomy for lumbar canal stenosis were recruited. Back pain and disability were assessed by use of the Visual Analog Score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey. During surgery, IMP was recorded continuously from the multifidus muscle by use of a pressure transducer. The intramuscular perfusion pressure (IPP) was estimated as the difference between the patient's mean arterial pressure and IMP. Two muscle retractors were used: the Norfolk and Norwich (n = 10) and the McCulloch (n = 10). The mean duration of deep muscle retraction was 62.7 +/- 8 minutes (range, 19-133 min). On application of deep muscle retraction, there was a rapid and sustained increase in IMP (P<0.001), and overall, the calculated mean IPP approached 0 mm Hg or less during this period (P<0.001). On release of deep muscle retraction, there was a rapid decrease in IMP to preoperative levels. The IPP was greater with the Norfolk and Norwich than the McCulloch retractor (P<0.001). Compared with preoperative values, there was a decrease in ODI (P<0.001) and VAS for back pain (P<0.001) at discharge and 4 to 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery. In addition, there was a decrease in SF-36 scores at 6 months compared with preoperative values (P<0.001). Total duration of muscle retraction greater than 60 minutes was associated with worse VAS scores for back pain and ODI and SF-36 scores for disability at 6 months after surgery (P<0.05). There was no relationship between the VAS, ODI, and SF-36 scores and other parameters measured, including the mean IPP, retractor type, operating surgeon, and wound length.","The McCulloch retractor generates a higher IMP than the Norfolk and Norwich retractor. However, postoperative improvement in VAS, ODI, and SF-36 scores in these patients was associated with a shorter duration of muscle retraction and not the degree of IMP or IPP generated. In this respect, periodic relaxation of the paraspinal muscle retractors during surgery to allow muscle perfusion may help to reduce postoperative back pain and disability.",closed_qa
Is the genotype CC of IL-28B SNP rs12979860 significantly associated with a sustained virological response in chronic HCV-infected Pakistani patients?,"To evaluate the association of genetic variation in interleukin 28B (IL-28B) gene and viral factors with treatment outcome in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients in Pakistan. Patients with chronic HCV infection who received interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy were enrolled in the study. The viral loads were checked at the third and sixth month of treatment and 6 months after the completion of the treatment. Genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12979860 of IL-28B gene was performed by the restriction fragment length polymorphism method and direct sequence analysis. A total of 111 patients successfully completed antiviral therapy and the follow-up period. Early virological response (EVR) and a sustained virological response (SVR) were achieved in 92 and 91 patients, respectively. Patients infected with HCV genotype 3a had a higher SVR rate compared with other HCV genotypes. A higher C allele frequency (81.9%) was observed in patients with SVR than those with non-SVR (P = 0.00001). The odds ratio of achieving SVR was more than 10-fold greater for the CC genotype than the CT/TT genotypes of SNP rs12979860 (OR 10.351, 95% CI 1.925-55.653, P = 0.006).

Do primary CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and lymphomatoid papulosis frequently express cytotoxic proteins?,"To analyse the relationship between expression of cytotoxic proteins, histopathology and the CD30 status in primary cutaneous T-cell disorders, we investigated the expression of TIA-1, granzyme B and perforin in CD30 negative and CD30 positive cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) and lymphomatoid papulosis (LP). We studied 26 cases of CTCL and 12 cases of LP for the expression of TIA-1, granzyme B and perforin which are granule-associated proteins of cytotoxic lymphocytes involved in the mechanism of apoptosis. We showed that most cases (10/13) of CD30 negative pleomorphic lymphomas expressed cytotoxic proteins only in scattered, apparently reactive lymphocytes, the exception being one CD8+ CTCL and two gammadelta subcutaneous 'panniculitis-like' T-cell lymphomas. We also showed that at least one cytotoxic protein was expressed in a proportion of neoplastic cells in 77% (10/13) of CD30+ T-cell lymphomas (3/4 pleomorphic and 7/9 anaplastic) and in a proportion of atypical cells in 75% (9/12) of LP.","Our findings show a strong correlation between the CD30 phenotype and the expression of cytotoxic proteins in primary CTCL. In addition, these results provide further evidence for an overlap between lymphomatoid papulosis and cutaneous CD30+ pleomorphic and anaplastic lymphomas. These entities, which belong to the spectrum of CD30 positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferations, appear to be derived from cytotoxic cells.",closed_qa
Does short-term caloric restriction reduce bone mineral density in rats with early type 2 diabetes?,"The effect of caloric restriction (CR) in the setting of diabetes on bone metabolism has not yet been fully studied. The aim of this study is to determine if short-term CR alters bone mass and metabolism in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of type 2 diabetes. Four groups (n=5) were created: OLETF rats with food ad libitum (AL), OLETF rats with CR, Long-Evans Tokusima Otsuka (LETO) rats with food AL, and LETO rats with CR. The CR condition was imposed on 24-week-old male rats using a 40% calorie reduction for 4 weeks. The effect of CR on femoral bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Serum markers were measured by immunoassay. After 4 weeks of CR, body weight decreased in both strains. The BMD decreased in LETO rats and was maintained in OLETF rats. After adjustment for body weight, BMD remained lower in LETO rats (P=0.017) but not OLETF rats (P=0.410). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels decreased in LETO rats (P=0.025) but not in OLEFT rats (P=0.347). Serum leptin levels were reduced after CR in both strains, but hyperleptinemia remained in OLETF rats (P=0.009). CR increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in OLETF rats (P=0.009) but not in LETO rats (P=0.117). Additionally, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α levels decreased only in OLETF rats (P=0.009).",Short-term CR and related weight loss were associated with decreases of femoral BMD in LETO rats while BMD was maintained in OLETF rats.

Do pathophysiological relationships between lower urinary tract symptoms and the prostate strengthen over time?,"The aim of this survey was to examine the relationships among baseline prostate gland volume and changes in urinary symptomatology 3 years later. A Scottish community-based cohort of 193 men aged 40-79 years who had prostate volume measured by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) were followed-up at 3 years. Only baseline nocturia correlated with prostate volume (r = 0.202, P = 0.0057), although some relationships existed for the antero-posterior dimension of the prostate gland. More statistically significant relationships were evident for adenoma volume rather than prostate volume, but they still had relatively low correlations (range, 0.19-0.31).","This study demonstrates the lack of relationships between prostate gland variables and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Those relationships that are statistically significant (at the P < 0.01 level) are weak, and only explain at most 9% of the total variation of prostate or adenoma volume or their dimensions.",closed_qa
Should obstetricians see women with normal pregnancies?,"To compare routine antenatal care provided by general practitioners and midwives with obstetrician led shared care. Multicentre randomised controlled trial. 51 general practices linked to nine Scottish maternity hospitals. 1765 women at low risk of antenatal complications. Routine antenatal care by general practitioners and midwives according to a care plan and protocols for managing complications. Comparisons of health service use, indicators of quality of care, and women's satisfaction. Continuity of care was improved for the general practitioner and midwife group as the number of carers was less (median 5 carers v 7 for shared care group, P<0.0001) and the number of routine visits reduced (10.9 v 11.7, P<0.0001). Fewer women in the general practitioner and midwife group had antenatal admissions (27% (222/834) v 32% (266/840), P<0.05), non-attendances (7% (57) v 11% (89), P<0.01) and daycare (12% (102) v 7% (139), P<0.05) but more were referred (49% (406) v 36% (305), P<0.0001). Rates of antenatal diagnoses did not differ except that fewer women in the general practitioner and midwife group had hypertensive disorders (pregnancy induced hypertension, 5% (37) v 8% (70), P<0.01) and fewer had labour induced (18% (149) v 24% (201), P<0.01). Few failures to comply with the care protocol occurred, but more Rhesus negative women in the general practitioner and midwife group did not have an appropriate antibody check (2.5% (20) v 0.4% (3), P<0.0001). Both groups expressed high satisfaction with care (68% (453/663) v 65% (430/656), P=0.5) and acceptability of allocated style of care (93% (618) v 94% (624), P=0.6).

Is there age bias in the treatment of localized prostate carcinoma?,"Treatment recommendations for localized prostate carcinoma are based on the patient's remaining life expectancy (RLE), which is influenced by age, comorbidity, and tumor grade. Previous studies have evaluated the influence of age and comorbidity, but to the authors' knowledge not RLE, on actual treatment decisions. An age-stratified random sample of 347 patients was generated from a cohort of all patients with newly diagnosed prostate carcinoma in the Ontario Cancer Registry between May 1, 1995 and April 30, 1996 (n = 5192). Chart review was performed to obtain detailed tumor, comorbidity, and treatment information. RLE was estimated from a published model derived from a cohort of 451 men with untreated prostate carcinoma who were followed for 15 years. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate predictors of treatment, such as radical prostatectomy (RP), radiotherapy (RT), or potentially curative therapy (RP or RT), in relation to patient age, comorbidity, tumor characteristics, and RLE. RP was provided within 6 months of diagnosis to 58.7%, 32.1%, 2.6%, and 0% of patients of ages<60 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80+ years, respectively. The results for RT were 6.4%, 30.9%, 23.4%, and 3.3%, respectively. Increasing comorbidity decreased rates of RP but did not affect use of RT. After controlling for comorbidity and tumor characteristics, older men were found to be treated with RP less often than younger men with similar RLE, whereas RLE did not appear to influence receipt of RT.","Although different mechanisms may account for these results, an age bias may be present among urologists and radiation oncologists treating men with localized prostate carcinoma.",closed_qa
Is transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 receptor stimulation by hydrogen peroxide critical to trigger pain during monosodium urate-induced inflammation in rodents?,"Gout is a common cause of inflammatory arthritis and is provoked by the accumulation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. However, the underlying mechanisms of the pain associated with acute attacks of gout are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA-1) and TRPA-1 stimulants, such as H2 O2 , in a rodent model of MSU-induced inflammation. MSU or H2 O2 was injected into the hind paws of rodents or applied in cultured sensory neurons, and the intracellular calcium response was measured in vitro. Inflammatory or nociceptive responses in vivo were evaluated using pharmacologic, genetic, or biochemical tools and methods. TRPA-1 antagonism, TRPA-1 gene deletion, or pretreatment of peptidergic TRP-expressing primary sensory neurons with capsaicin markedly decreased MSU-induced nociception and edema. In addition to these neurogenic effects, MSU increased H2 O2 levels in the injected tissue, an effect that was abolished by the H2 O2 -detoxifying enzyme catalase. H2 O2 , but not MSU, directly stimulated sensory neurons through the activation of TRPA-1. The nociceptive responses evoked by MSU or H2 O2 injection were attenuated by the reducing agent dithiothreitol. In addition, MSU injection increased the expression of TRPA-1 and TRP vanilloid channel 1 (TRPV-1) and also enhanced cellular infiltration and interleukin-1β levels, and these effects were blocked by TRPA-1 antagonism.","Our results suggest that MSU injection increases tissue H2 O2 , thereby stimulating TRPA-1 on sensory nerve endings to produce inflammation and nociception. TRPV-1, by a previously unknown mechanism, also contributes to these responses.",closed_qa
Do men and women differ in their course following traumatic brain injury?,"To examine the effect of a patient's sex on measures of outcome in a matched sample of patients admitted for acute traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Forty-five men were then matched with regards to age and injury severity. All subjects met the study criteria of having a moderate-to-severe TBI and aged 50 years old or younger. Exclusion criteria included history of previous head injury, psychiatric disturbance and significant alcohol and/or substance abuse. Data included injury details and physiological and psychometric measures of outcome.

Can a screening questionnaire accurately identify mild Parkinsonian signs?,"Mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) are early features that, when present, increase the risk of neurodegenerative disease and mortality. Current methods to identify MPS are limited to neurological examination. Our objective was to assess the ability of a 9-item Parkinson's Disease Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ), which has high sensitivity in the detection of overt Parkinson's disease (PD), to detect MPS. Measures including the PDSQ, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test were administered to 267 participants without neurodegenerative disease. Two published definitions of MPS were used to classify cases. PDSQ scores were higher for cases compared to controls (p<0.001 for the first case definition and 0.07 for the second). However, the questionnaire had low sensitivity (47 and 59%) and specificity (62 and 63%) in the detection of MPS. Adding factors such as age, gender and smell test score to the questionnaire in a predictive model only marginally improved the test characteristics.","The results show the screening questionnaire does not accurately identify MPS. More accurate tests are needed to improve the detection of this early syndrome which can lead to motor disability, neurodegenerative disease and mortality.",closed_qa

Does no difference exist in the alteration of circadian rhythm between patients with and without intensive care unit psychosis?,"To determine if a difference exists in the circadian rhythm entrainment between patients with and without intensive care unit (ICU) psychosis. Retrospective chart reviews from 149 consecutive patients admitted to our ICU during the period of January 1993 to August 1993. Twelve patients with a history of mental illness or alcohol or substance abuse were excluded from the study. A 20-bed surgical ICU at a large teaching hospital. Patients who remained in the ICU for a minimum of 2 days after undergoing thoracic or vascular operations. None. Hourly temperature and urine output were ascertained from the patient records. The time of temperature and urine output nadir was used as a marker of circadian rhythm. Of the 137 patients included in the study, 17 (12.4%) developed ICU psychosis as defined by standard criteria. The time of temperature nadir was randomly distributed around the clock for each group. Cosinar rhythmometry analysis of temperature data showed a lack of circadian rhythm entrainment in most patients up to the third postoperative day. No statistically significant difference exists in the deviation of such impairment between the groups.","Either patients who develop ICU psychosis have an increased sensitivity to an alteration of their circadian rhythm, or ICU psychosis develops independent of circadian rhythm abnormalities.",closed_qa
Are underactive and overactive bladders related to motor function and quality of life in Parkinson 's disease?,"Overactive bladder occurs in up to 70% and underactive bladder in up to 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), which is thought to reflect an altered frontal-basal ganglia circuit. However, it is not clear how bladder disorder is related to motor function and to quality of life (QOL) in PD. We studied these relationships by conducting multiple regression (MR) and bivariate correlation (BV) statistical analyses. We recruited 58 PD patients, irrespective of the presence of bladder disorder: 35 men and 23 women of mean age 66.8 years, mean duration of the disease 5.4 years, and median score of Hoehn-Yahr stage 3. We administered a bladder questionnaire including two major types of lower urinary tract symptoms, 'overactive bladder (OAB)' and 'voiding difficulty,' in addition to a QOL index and a pressure-flow urodynamic study to detect detrusor overactivity (DO) during filling; and detrusor weakness, outlet obstruction, and post-void residuals (PVR) during voiding. We analyzed the results using the MR and BV methods. (1) Motor impairment (by HY grades) was significantly related to detrusor weakness (P < 0.05 MR); voiding difficulty, OAB (P < 0.05 BV) (by de novo, levodopa honeymoon, and wearing-off); and voiding difficulty (P < 0.05 MR). (2) Bladder QOL was significantly related to OAB, increased bladder sensation (P < 0.05 MR) and voiding difficulty (P < 0.05 BV). (3) Male gender was significantly related to outlet obstruction, DO (P < 0.05 MR). (4) Age was significantly related to DO and PVR (P < 0.05 MR). Disease duration was significantly related to OAB (P < 0.05 MR).","From these results, detrusor weakness (relevant to motor impairment) and OAB (relevant to bladder QOL) are thought to be fundamental in PD. In contrast to the mechanism of OAB, the mechanism of detrusor weakness in PD remains unclear and warrants further exploration.",closed_qa
Novel insertion and deletion mutations in the 5'-UTR of the folate receptor-alpha gene: an additional contributor to hyperhomocysteinemia?,"To search for mutations in the 5'-UTR and proximal promoter region of the folate receptor-alpha (FR-alpha) gene, whose exons are known to be virtually free of genetic variation in the population. Seven hundred seventy-eight patient samples were screened for mutations between nt -116 and nt +207 in the FR-alpha gene using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by DNA sequencing. Three patients were found to have a 25-bp deletion, c.109_133delCCACTAAACCACAGCTGTCCCCTGG, and three others had a 1-bp A insertion, c.-69dupA, so that 0.77% of the patient population showed genetic variation already in the 323 bp promoter sequence studied so far.","The promoter region of FR-alpha may harbor much more genetic variation than its highly conserved exons, and not just isolated, unique mutations.

Does coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor expression predict the efficiency of adenoviral gene transfer into non-small cell lung cancer xenografts?,"Current paradigms postulate that inefficient adenoviral (Ad) gene transfer is a consequence of poor Coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) expression in tumors in vivo. To test whether exuberant CAR expression alone is sufficient to mediate efficient Ad gene transfer, we compared Ad gene transfer efficiency in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell model systems in which we systematically measured CAR expression in vitro and in vivo. NSCLC cells were selected for study on the basis of (a) differences in Ad transduction, (b) identical requirements for growth in vitro, (c) capacity to grow as xenografts in immunocompromised mice, and (d) similar amounts of alpha(v) integrin expression as measured by flow cytometry. CAR expression and Ad transduction profiles of these NSCLC cells were generated in vitro and in vivo. Ad transduction efficiency of NSCLC cells in vitro can be directly related to CAR expression at both the mRNA and protein level. CAR expression in vitro favorably predicts a comparable pattern of expression in transplanted NSCLC xenografts in vivo. Xenografts generated from NSCLC cells exhibiting increased CAR expression showed evidence of higher Ad gene transfer, although the efficiency of transduction was reduced compared with in vitro measurements. Thus, in NSCLC cells with high basal expression of CAR, Ad vector doses that enabled uniform transduction in vitro achieve a gene transfer efficiency ranging from 10% to 70% after a single intratumoral injection in the xenografts.",These studies indicate CAR expression is predictive for more efficient gene transfer into NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo but is not sufficient to achieve uniform transduction by Group C Ad vectors in vivo.,closed_qa
Is toll-like receptor 9 suppression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells after IgE-dependent activation mediated by autocrine TNF-alpha?,"Functional significance for the alphagamma(2) variant of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) reportedly expressed on human dendritic cell subtypes remains poorly understood. Studies show that immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) secrete large quantities of TNF-alpha and IL-6 when directly stimulated with anti-IgE antibody. This mode of activation, however, reduces Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) expression in pDCs and their ability to mount an IFN-alpha response when subsequently activated with oligodeoxynucleotide containing CpG. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this IgE-dependent suppression of TLR9 and innate immune responsiveness in pDCs by focusing on autocrine cytokine responses. pDCs were isolated from blood by using blood dendritic cell antigen 4 selection. Cytokine responses to anti-IgE antibody-dependent and/or CpG-dependent stimulation were measured by using ELISA. TLR9 expression was determined by using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The time required for downregulating TLR9 expression in pDCs after anti-IgE stimulation correlated with the induction and duration of TNF-alpha secreted by these cells. Pretreatment of pDCs with recombinant TNF-alpha (but not IL-6 or IL-10) markedly suppressed TLR9 expression. Functional response to CpG (ie, IFN-alpha induction) was also inhibited with TNF-alpha pretreatment (inhibitory concentration(50) = approximately 200 pg/mL). Finally, an antibody that neutralizes TNF-alpha activity completely restored TLR9 expression during anti-IgE stimulation and significantly improved IFN-alpha secretion on subsequent activation with CpG.",Autocrine TNF-alpha secretion resulting from IgE/FcepsilonRI-dependent activation plays a critical role in suppressing TLR9-dependent responses in pDCs that normally promote T(H)1 activity.,closed_qa
Is pDGF-induced migration of vascular smooth muscle cells inhibited by heme oxygenase-1 via VEGFR2 upregulation and subsequent assembly of inactive VEGFR2/PDGFRβ heterodimers?,"In cardiovascular regulation, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity has been shown to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation by promoting cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. However, the effect of HO-1 on VSMC migration remains unclear. We aim to elucidate the mechanism by which HO-1 regulates PDGFBB-induced VSMC migration. Transduction of HO-1 cDNA adenoviral vector severely impeded human VSMC migration in a scratch, transmembrane, and directional migration assay in response to PDGFBB stimulation. Similarly, HO-1 overexpression in the remodeling process during murine retinal vasculature development attenuated VSMC coverage over the major arterial branches as compared with sham vector-transduced eyes. HO-1 expression in VSMCs significantly upregulated VEGFA and VEGFR2 expression, which subsequently promoted the formation of inactive PDGFRβ/VEGFR2 complexes. This compromised PDGFRβ phosphorylation and impeded the downstream cascade of FAK-p38 signaling. siRNA-mediated silencing of VEGFA or VEGFR2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of HO-1 on VSMC migration.","These findings identify a potent antimigratory function of HO-1 in VSMCs, a mechanism that involves VEGFA and VEGFR2 upregulation, followed by assembly of inactive VEGFR2/PDGFRβ complexes that attenuates effective PDGFRβ signaling.",closed_qa
Does carbamazepine attenuate inducible nitric oxide synthase expression through Akt inhibition in activated microglial cells?,"Abstract Background: Carbamazepine, which was developed primarily for the treatment of epilepsy, is now also useful for the treatment of non-epileptic disorders and inflammatory hyperalgesia. However, the mechanism of its anti-neuroinflammatory action remains poorly understood. This study elucidates the anti-neuroinflammatory capacity of carbamazepine on microglial activation and the relative mechanisms involved. The microglial BV-2 cells were pretreated with carbamazepine for 15 min before activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After LPS stimulation, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was analyzed by Western blotting (WB) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Signaling proteins and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 were also evaluated by WB. The levels of nitrate and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were analyzed by the Griess method and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, respectively. The formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was examined by fluorescent analysis. Carbamazepine strongly attenuated LPS-induced production of NO and iNOS protein at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 μM. Consistently, it could markedly suppress iNOS mRNA expression stimulated by LPS. Among the signaling pathways, LPS-mediated IκBα degradation or JNK MAPK phosphorylation was not affected by carbamazepine. Interestingly, it was found that carbamazepine could concentration-dependently inhibit LPS-activated phospho-Akt expression. Nevertheless, LPS-induced ROS production was not affected by carbamazepine. Carbamazepine (20 μM) affected either COX-2 expression or TNF-α production induced by LPS with approximately 70% and 51% inhibition, respectively.","Our findings showed that carbamazepine exerted selective inhibition on LPS-induced microglial iNOS expression through the down-regulation of Akt activation, and thus may play a pivotal role of anti-neuroinflammation in its therapeutic efficacy.",closed_qa
"Are leptin receptor neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus key regulators of energy expenditure and body weight , but not food intake?","Leptin responsive neurons play an important role in energy homeostasis, controlling specific autonomic, behavioral, and neuroendocrine functions. We have previously identified a population of leptin receptor (LepRb) expressing neurons within the dorsomedial hypothalamus/dorsal hypothalamic area (DMH/DHA) which are related to neuronal circuits that control brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Intra-DMH leptin injections also activate sympathetic outflow to BAT, but whether such effects are mediated directly via DMH/DHA LepRb neurons and whether this is physiologically relevant for whole body energy expenditure and body weight regulation has yet to be determined. We used pharmacosynthetic receptors (DREADDs) to selectively activate DMH/DHA LepRb neurons. We further deleted LepRb with virally driven cre-recombinase from DMH/DHA neurons and determined the physiological importance of DMH/DHA LepRb neurons in whole body energy homeostasis. Neuronal activation of DMH/DHA LepRb neurons with DREADDs promoted BAT thermogenesis and locomotor activity, which robustly induced energy expenditure (p < 0.001) and decreases body weight (p < 0.001). Similarly, intra-DMH/DHA leptin injections normalized hypothermia and attenuated body weight gain in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Conversely, ablation of LepRb from DMH/DHA neurons remarkably drives weight gain (p < 0.001) by reducing energy expenditure (p < 0.001) and locomotor activity (p < 0.001). The observed changes in body weight were largely independent of food intake.","Taken together, our data highlight that DMH/DHA LepRb neurons are sufficient and necessary to regulate energy expenditure and body weight.",closed_qa
Is self-medication with antibiotics in Europe driven by prescribed use?,"Self-medication with antibiotics may increase the risk of inappropriate use and the selection of resistant bacteria. One of the triggers for using self-medication may be past experience with antibiotics prescribed by health professionals. We examined the association between prescribed use and self-medication with antibiotics. A population survey was conducted in 19 European countries, covering 15,548 respondents. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to study the relationship between prescribed use and self-medication for all symptoms/diseases and for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). The association between prescribed use and self-medication was modified by source of self-medication, region in Europe and education. This association was consistently stronger for self-medication from leftovers than from other sources, primarily directly from a pharmacy. It was stronger also for respondents from Northern/Western Europe than respondents from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe and those with low education. Prescribed use for URTIs (minor ailments such as throat symptom, influenza, etc.) increased the likelihood of self-medication with leftover antibiotics for these symptoms/diseases in all European regions.","Our study shows consistent associations between prescribed use and self-medication with antibiotics from leftovers, but has not been able to support the hypothesis that self-medication from other sources than leftovers is triggered by earlier prescribed use. Preventing leftovers may be one effective way of preventing self-medication. This can be achieved by ensuring that the amount dispensed corresponds to the amount prescribed, by educating patients and by making doctors aware that prescribing for minor ailments may increase the risk of self-medication for such ailments.",closed_qa
Training prescription in patients on beta-blockers: percentage peak exercise methods or self-regulation?,"Exercise prescription based on percentage of peak exercise variables has many limitations in patients taking beta-blockers. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of a training protocol based on the rating of perceived exercise (RPE) in patients taking beta-blockers after cardiac surgical revascularization. 71 patients treated with beta-blockers after recent coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly allocated to two different programmes with training intensity adjusted to keep heart rate close to first ventilatory threshold (36 subjects, AeT group) or RPE between grades 4 and 5 of 10-point category-ratio BORG scale (35 subjects, RPE group). In the RPE group, mean training workloads and heart rate values were significantly higher than in the AeT group; during the last week of the programme, six RPE patients were training very close to anaerobic threshold. Aerobic peak capacity increased similarly in the two groups. Considering the potential effects on training intensity of prescriptions based on percentages of peak exercise variables, we found that only percentage heart rate reserve and peak workload methods were reliable in defining a safe upper limit of training intensity, with values of 50% and 65% respectively.","Self-regulation of exercise training intensity between grades 4 and 5 of the 10-point category-ratio BORG scale is effective but may promote overtraining in some patients without significant functional advantages. For these reasons, RPE method should be integrated with objective indices based on percentage of heart rate reserve or of peak workload.",closed_qa
Impairment of sleep-related memory consolidation in schizophrenia: relevance of sleep spindles?,"Deficits in declarative memory performance are among the most severe neuropsychological impairments in schizophrenia and contribute to poor clinical outcomes. The importance of sleep for brain plasticity and memory consolidation is widely accepted, and sleep spindles seem to play an important role in these processes. The aim of this study was to test the associations of sleep spindles and picture memory consolidation in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We studied 16 patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic medication (mean age ± standard deviation, 29.4 ± 6.4 years) and 16 healthy controls matched for age and educational level. Sleep was recorded and scored according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard criteria. We performed a picture recognition paradigm and compared recognition performance for neutral and emotional pictures in sleep and wake conditions. Recognition accuracy was better in healthy controls than in patients with schizophrenia in the sleep and wake conditions. However, the memory-promoting effect of sleep was significantly lower in schizophrenia patients than in controls. Sleep spindle activity was reduced in patients, and sleep spindle density was correlated with sleep-associated facilitation of recognition accuracy for neutral pictures.","Reduced sleep spindles seem to play an important role as a possible mechanism or biomarker for impaired sleep-related memory consolidation in patients with schizophrenia, and are a new target for treatment to improve memory functions and clinical outcomes in these patients.",closed_qa
Do nUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF MALNUTRITION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?,"Despite the high global prevalence of malnutrition, it remains under-treated, or undetected. The high energy nutritional supplements are usually prescribed to promote rapid weight gain. However, there is no consensus on the most effective way to treat mild to moderate malnutrition. For identification of articles search engines of the databases OVID, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Pub med were used for papers published from 2003 to 2014 in English language. The total energy intake including the supplements is significantly improved. However, the rate of weight gain by the high energy nutritional supplements in moderately malnourished children is less than the expected weight gain.","While assessing the impact of the supplementation on child nutritional status, other factors should also be taken into account, including appetite suppression, replacement of habitual food intake and compliance to the intervention.",closed_qa
Do subjective health complaints predict functional outcome six months after stroke?,"Cerebrovascular stroke is a main cause of lasting disability in older age, and initial stroke severity has been established as a main determinant for the degree of functional loss. In this study, we searched for other predictors of functional outcome in a cohort of stroke patients participating in an early supported discharge randomised controlled trial. Thirty candidate variables related either to premorbid history or to the acute stroke were examined by ordered logistic regression in 229 stroke patients. Dependent variables were modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months and mRS change from baseline to 6 months. For mRS at 6 months, Barthel Index at stable baseline post-stroke was the main predictor, with sex, age, previous cerebrovascular disease, previous peripheral artery disease and the necessity for tube feeding in the acute phase also contributing to the final model. For mRS change, only age and previous cerebrovascular disease were significant predictors. Prestroke subjective health complaints added significantly to all final models concurrently with sex losing its predictive power.",Initial stroke severity was the main predictor of functional outcome. Subjective health complaints score was a potent predictor for both outcome and improvement from baseline to 6 months and at the same time ameliorated the predictive impact of sex. The poorer functional prognosis for women after stroke may therefore be related to their higher load of subjective health complaints rather than to their sex itself. Treating these complaints may possibly improve the functional prognosis.,closed_qa
Are thyrotropin secretion profiles different in men and women?,"The hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis in women may differ from that in men. Previous reports have shown an almost 2-fold increased response to TRH in females compared with males. We analyzed TSH profiles in healthy men and women to delineate differences in the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid system. The subjects, 24 men (mean age 44 +/- 3 yr) and 22 women (mean age 42 +/- 3 yr) underwent a 24-h study with blood sampling intervals of 10 min. Premenopausal women were investigated in the early follicular phase of the cycle. Serum TSH concentration profiles were analyzed with a newly developed automated deconvolution program, approximate entropy, and cosinor regression. Basal and pulsatile TSH secretion, and also pulse frequency, hormone half-lives, and secretory mode were indistinguishable in the two genders. There were no differences in diurnal variation, and the times of maximal secretion coincided. Approximate entropy, reflecting secretory regularity, was not different between men and women. In women but not men, TSH secretion was dependent linearly on age.",TSH secretion is gender invariant and depends on age in women only.,closed_qa
Does catheter based selective hypothermia reduce stroke volume during focal cerebral ischemia in swine?,"Total body hypothermia is an established neuroprotectant in global cerebral ischemia. The role of hypothermia in acute ischemic stroke remains uncertain. Selective application of hypothermia to a region of focal ischemia may provide similar protection with more rapid cooling and elimination of systemic side effects. We studied the effect of selective endovascular cooling in a focal stroke model in adult domestic swine. After craniotomy under general anesthesia, a proximal middle cerebral artery branch was occluded for 3 h, followed by 3 h of reperfusion. In half of the animals, selective hypothermia was induced during reperfusion using a dual lumen balloon occlusion catheter placed in the ipsilateral common carotid artery. Following reperfusion, the animals were sacrificed. Brain MRI and histology were evaluated by experts who were blinded to the intervention. 25 animals were available for analysis. Using selective hypothermia, hemicranial temperature was successfully cooled to a mean of 26.5 °C. Average time from start of perfusion to attainment of moderate hypothermia (<30 °C) was 25 min. Mean MRI stroke volumes were significantly reduced by selective cooling (0.050±0.059 control, 0.005±0.011 hypothermia (ratio stroke:hemisphere volume) (p=0.046). Stroke pathology volumes were reduced by 42% compared with controls (p=0.256).",Selective moderate hypothermia was rapidly induced using endovascular techniques in a clinically realistic swine stroke model. A significant reduction in stroke volume on MRI was observed. Endovascular selective hypothermia can provide neuroprotection within time frames relevant to acute ischemic stroke treatment.,closed_qa
Does endothoracic sonography improve the estimation of operability in locally advanced lung cancer?,"Patients with T4 non-small cell lung cancers with limited involvement of mediastinal structures can undergo resection, with acceptable long-term survival. Computed tomography has not proven to be reliable in determining the operability of locally advanced lung carcinoma. This study evaluated the ability of video-assisted thoracoscopy alone and with endothoracic sonography to determine operability. Computed tomography showed a close contact of the tumor with mediastinal structures (T4) in 155 patients. Staging was expanded with video-assisted thoracoscopy, followed by thoracoscopic ultrasound. Lateral thoracotomy with hilar and mediastinal dissection was considered the gold standard in determining operability. Thoracoscopic ultrasound, compared with thoracoscopy alone and computed tomography, had the highest sensitivity (94.1% vs 75.2% vs 43.6%, p < 0.001) and specificity (98.1% vs 57.4% vs 37.0%, p < 0.001) for determining operability. Computed tomography, thoracoscopy, and thoracoscopic ultrasound were falsely negative in 57 (36.8%), 25 (16.1%), and 6 (3.9%) patients and falsely positive in 34 (21.9%), 23 (14.8%), and 1 (0.6%). False-negative results for operability by thoracoscopic ultrasound were found only in tumors involving the left atrium (3.9%).",Estimation of operability in locally advanced lung cancer can be improved with video-assisted thoracoscopy and ultrasound. More than one-third of patients classified as inoperable by computed tomography were able to undergo complete resection.,closed_qa
Does geriatric nutritional risk index predict functional dependency and mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction?,"The clinical significance of nutritional risk assessment in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains undefined. Geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) is a simple nutritional assessment tool for elderly subjects. Its predictive value was evaluated in patients with HFpEF, a common HF phenotype in the elderly population. The present study enrolled 152 consecutive patients (mean age, 77 ± 11 years; male, 53.9%) who were hospitalized with HFpEF at the authors' institution. GNRI on admission was calculated as follows: 14.89 × serum albumin (g/dl)+41.7×body mass index/22. Characteristics and mortality (median follow-up of 2.1 years) were compared between 2 groups: low GNRI (<92) with moderate or severe nutritional risk; and high GNRI (≥ 92) with no or low nutritional risk. Patients in the low-GNRI group were more often female, and had lower serum hemoglobin and sodium, but higher serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), C-reactive protein, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) compared to those in the high-GNRI group (P<0.05, respectively). Physical activity at discharge measured by Barthel index was significantly lower in the low-GNRI group than the high-GNRI group (P<0.05). On Cox hazard analysis, lower GNRI predicted increased mortality independent of age, gender, prior HF hospitalization, and higher BUN and BNP (P<0.01).", GNRI may be useful for predicting functional dependency and mortality in patients with HFpEF.  ,closed_qa
Do you see what I see?,"A prospective study evaluated orthopedists' ratings of preoperative and postoperative cosmesis in adolescents undergoing posterior or anterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis. Measures evaluated how orthopedists rated outcome in relation to patient satisfaction with the surgical result. The reliability of physician-derived data as a method for evaluating scoliosis surgical outcomes has not been sufficiently explored and has not been related to patient satisfaction ratings with the postoperative result. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) the intrarater and interrater reliability estimates of orthopedists' ratings of scoliosis surgical outcomes and 2) the association between orthopedists' ratings and patient satisfaction ratings with the postoperative cosmesis. Six orthopedists independently rated preoperative and postoperative color slides for cosmetic deformity in 41 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Patients rated their satisfaction with the postoperative cosmesis 5 to 11 months after surgery. The intrarater and interrater reliabilities of orthopedists' assessments of scoliosis surgical outcomes ranged from fair to poor. Orthopedists' assessments of postoperative shoulder asymmetry significantly correlated with patient satisfaction ratings of cosmetic appearance following surgical correction of severe curves. Patient satisfaction ratings were unrelated to orthopedists' ratings of scar appearance, cosmetic deformity, and preoperative to postoperative cosmetic change.","Intrarater and interrater reliability estimates were unacceptably low when evaluating spinal surgical outcomes in these 41 patients.

Race: predictor versus proxy variable?,"To examine the impact of race on acute, rehabilitation, and long-term outcomes after spinal cord injury (SCI). Two case control studies (study 1: acute and rehabilitation outcomes, study 2: long-term outcomes) in which white and nonwhite individuals were matched case for case on multiple demographic, medical, and geographic characteristics with the rationale being that a case-control methodology would increase the internal validity of the design, thereby increasing confidence in the assertion that any between-group differences observed may be specifically attributed to race. Data drawn from the Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems. Institutional practice and general community. Study 1: 187 pairs of individuals, study 2: 158 pairs of matched individuals. Not applicable. Outcome measures assessed included economic (eg, cost of care), treatment-related (eg, length of hospital stay), functional (eg, FIM instrument), and medical (eg, number of medical complications) variables, as well as self-reported life satisfaction, level of handicap, and mental and physical health. In study 1, none of the outcome measures differed significantly across racial groups. Similarly, study 2 failed to indicate significant differences in any of the outcome variables across racial groups, with the exception that nonwhites were at increased risk of greater self-reported handicap in the area of mobility. Power analyses indicated these finding were not merely the result of inadequate power.","For the outcomes assessed in studies 1 and 2, race appeared to act primarily as a proxy for other variables (eg, injury severity, age, educational achievement), which in turn may be associated with poor outcome after SCI.

Is change of hemopexin level associated with the severity of sepsis in endotoxemic rat model and the outcome of septic patients?,"The purpose of the study is to uncover the role of hemopexin (HPX) as anti-inflammatory mediator in animals and humans. We injected rats with 5 and 10 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide to induce low- and high-grade endotoxemia (LGE and HGE), respectively, and we measured serum levels of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, and HPX at 0, 1, 3, and 6 hours after the injection. In a clinical study, we measured the initial serum HPX concentrations of septic shock patients. We evaluated the correlation between HPX levels and sepsis severity in rats and the predictive value of the HPX level for 28-day mortality of patients. In rats, serum interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor α concentrations were lower in LGE than in HGE, whereas the HPX level in HGE at 6 hours was significantly lower than in LGE (0.88, interquartile range [0.79-1.00] vs 1.33, interquartile range [1.29-1.49] mg/mL, P= .002). In patients, the initial serum HPX level in nonsurvivors was significantly lower than in survivors (0.75 vs 1.02 mg/mL, P< .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that HPX exhibited independent prognostic value for 28-day mortality, and its levels were closely related to Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores.",Low serum HPX levels are related to sepsis severity and could indicate poor prognosis for septic shock patients.,closed_qa
Can a clinically useful aortic pressure wave be derived from a radial pressure wave?,"The information contained in arterial pressure waveforms is probably underused by most clinicians who manage critically ill patients. It is not generally known that an aortic pressure wave can be synthesized by applying a generalized transfer function to the radial arterial pressure wave. We validated a commercially available system, SphygmoCo (PWV Medical, Sydney). Ascending aortic pressure waves were synthesized and comparisons were made between the synthesized aortic waveforms, the measured aortic and radial arterial waveforms. Ascending aortic pressure waves (catheter-tip manometer) and radial artery pressure waves (short fluid-filled catheter) were recorded simultaneously in 12 patients with angina pectoris (age 62-76 years) undergoing cardiac catheterization. Patients were studied at rest, following midazolam, sublingual nitroglycerin and during Valsalva manoeuvres. Both midazolam and nitroglycerin lowered mean arterial pressure but nitroglycerin caused a more selective decrease in the measured and synthesized aortic systolic pressures than in the radial artery pressure. The synthesized aortic systolic pressure was less, by 6-8 mm Hg (SD 2-3) and the synthesized aortic diastolic pressure greater, by 4 mm Hg (SD 2). Despite these differences in pulse pressure, the synthesized waveform tracked the measured waveform before and during interventions.","By deriving an aortic waveform from the radial pulse, monitoring of left ventricular afterload can improve without more invasive means.",closed_qa
Is increased calcium supplementation associated with morbidity and mortality in the infant postoperative cardiac patient?,"The purpose of this study was to assess the association of calcium replacement therapy with morbidity and mortality in infants after cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass. Retrospective chart review. The cardiac intensive care unit at a tertiary care children's hospital. Infants undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass between October 2002 and August 2004. None. Total calcium replacement (mg/kg calcium chloride given) for the first 72 postoperative hours was measured. Morbidity and mortality data were collected. The total volume of blood products given during the first 72 hrs was recorded. Infants with confirmed chromosomal deletions at the 22q11 locus were noted. Correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to generate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with p < .05 being significant. One hundred seventy-one infants met inclusion criteria. Age was 4 +/- 3 months and weight was 4.9 +/- 1.7 kg at surgery. Six infants had deletions of chromosome 22q11. Infants who weighed less required more calcium replacement (r = -.28, p < .001). Greater calcium replacement correlated with a longer intensive care unit length of stay (r = .27, p < .001) and a longer total hospital length of stay (r = .23, p = .002). Greater calcium replacement was significantly associated with morbidity (liver dysfunction [odds ratio, 3.9; confidence interval, 2.1-7.3; p < .001], central nervous system complication [odds ratio, 1.8; confidence interval, 1.1-3.0; p = .02], infection [odds ratio, 1.5; confidence interval, 1.0-2.2; p < .04], extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [odds ratio, 5.0; confidence interval, 2.3-10.6; p < .001]) and mortality (odds ratio, 5.8; confidence interval, 5.8-5.9; p < .001). Greater calcium replacement was not associated with renal insufficiency (odds ratio, 1.5; confidence interval, 0.9-2.3; p = .07). Infants with >1 sd above the mean of total calcium replacement received on average fewer blood products than the total study population.",Greater calcium replacement is associated with increasing morbidity and mortality.

Does emotional intelligence predict breaking bad news skills in pediatric interns?,"While both patients and physicians identify communication of bad news as an area of great challenge, the factors underlying this often complex task remain largely unknown. Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively correlated with good general communication skills and successful leadership, but there is no literature relating EI to the delivery of bad news. Our objectives were to determine: 1) performance of first-year pediatric residents in the delivery of bad news in a standardized patient (SP) setting; and 2) the role of EI in these assessments. Our hypothesis was that pediatric trainees with higher EI would demonstrate more advanced skills in this communication task. Forty first-year residents participated. Skill in bad news delivery was assessed via SP encounters using a previously published assessment tool (GRIEV_ING Death Notification Protocol). Residents completed the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI) as a measure of EI. Residents scored poorly on bad news delivery skills but scored well on EI. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability among raters using the delivering bad news assessment tool. However, no correlation was found between bad news delivery performance and EI.","We concluded that first-year pediatric residents have inadequate skills in the delivery of bad news. In addition, our data suggest that higher EI alone is not sufficient to effectively deliver death news and more robust skill training is necessary for residents to gain competence and acquire mastery in this important communication domain.",closed_qa
Cognitive status at admission: does it affect the rehabilitation outcome of elderly patients with hip fracture?,"To determine the effect of cognitive status at admission on functional gain during rehabilitation of elderly hip-fractured patients. Cohort study. A hospital geriatric rehabilitation department. Two hundred twenty-four elderly patients admitted consecutively for rehabilitation after surgery for hip fracture. Cognitive status was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the cognitive subscale of the Functional Independence Measure (cognFIM); functional status was assessed by the motor subscale of FIM; absolute functional gain was determined by the motor FIM gain (deltamotFIM); and relative functional gain (based on the potential for improvement) by the Montebello rehabilitation factor score (MRFS). A significant increase in FIM scores (19.7) occurred during rehabilitation, mainly due to motor functioning (19.1). When the relative functional gain (as measured by both motor MRFS efficacy [r = .591] and efficiency [r = .376]was compared with the absolute gain (as measured by deltamotFIM [r = .304]), a stronger association between cognFIM and the relative measures was found. In addition, motor FIM efficacy and efficiency were significantly lower in the cognitively impaired patients (p<.01). A better rehabilitation outcome was seen in patients with higher admission cognitive status, adjusting for the effects of age, sex, length of stay, and type of fracture (odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.7).","Impaired cognitive status at admission lowered the rehabilitation outcome of elderly hip fracture patients. Cognitive impairment was strongly and directly associated with functional gain in these patients. Absolute motor gain appeared to be independent of cognitive status, whereas the relative motor gain depended on it.

Is a history of early life parental loss or separation associated with successful cognitive-behavioral therapy in major depressive disorder?,"There is a clinical need for evidence-based psychotherapy response biomarkers in major depressive disorder (MDD). Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that lower 24-h urinary cortisol levels and a history of early life stress/trauma would predict an improved antidepressant response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). 50 currently depressed MDD subjects were enrolled. 24-h urine was collected and measured for cortisol levels by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Subjects were also administered early life stress/trauma measures at baseline: Global Perceived Early-Life Stress (GPELS), The Early Life Trauma Inventory (ELTI) and Klein Loss Scale (KLS). The efficacy of a twelve-week course of once-weekly CBT was evaluated by the primary outcome measure, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS24), at baseline and every four weeks, and the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline and weekly thereafter. 42 subjects had at least one complete follow-up visit (≥4 weeks of CBT), and 30 subjects completed the full 12-week course. Baseline 24-h urinary cortisol levels did not correlate with CBT's antidepressant response. Higher KLS scores, a measure of early life parental loss or separation, correlated with delta HDRS24 (rs=-0.39, padjusted=0.05).

Is tegafur-uracil a safe alternative for the treatment of colorectal cancer in patients with partial dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency : a proof of principle?,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of using tegafur-uracil (UFT) in colorectal cancer patients with partial dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. The study included five colorectal cancer patients who presented with acute toxicity (grades 3 and 4) after being given the first cycle of chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil. The DPD deficiency was confirmed by gene sequencing. After a full recovery from all side effects, we changed the regimen to UFT (300 mg/m(2)/day) associated with leucovorin (90 mg/day) for 21 days, with an empirical dose reduction of at least 10% in the first cycle. We prospectively analysed 22 UFT cycles in 5 patients. We did not observe any episodes of grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The predominant toxicities were of grades 1 and 2 (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea).","Here, we demonstrate a complete absence of severe toxicity in all patients and cycles analysed.

Does immunotherapy targeting folate receptor induce cell death associated with autophagy in ovarian cancer?,"Cancer cells are highly dependent on folate metabolism, making them susceptible to drugs that inhibit folate receptor activities. Targeting overexpressed folate receptor alpha (FRα) in cancer cells offers a therapeutic opportunity. We investigated the functional mechanisms of MORAB-003 (farletuzumab), a humanized mAb against FRα, in ovarian cancer models. We first examined FRα expression in an array of human ovarian cancer cell lines and then assessed the in vivo effect of MORAB-003 on tumor growth and progression in several orthotopic mouse models of ovarian cancer derived from these cell lines. Molecular mechanisms of tumor cell death induced by MORAB-003 were investigated by cDNA and protein expression profiling analysis. Mechanistic studies were performed to determine the role of autophagy in MORAB-003-induced cell death. MORAB-003 significantly decreased tumor growth in the high-FRα IGROV1 and SKOV3ip1 models but not in the low-FRα A2780 model. MORAB-003 reduced proliferation, but had no significant effect on apoptosis. Protein expression and cDNA microarray analyses showed that MORAB-003 regulated an array of autophagy-related genes. It also significantly increased expression of LC3 isoform II and enriched autophagic vacuolization. Blocking autophagy with hydroxychloroquine or bafilomycin A1 reversed the growth inhibition induced by MORAB-003. In addition, alteration of FOLR1 gene copy number significantly correlated with shorter disease-free survival in patients with ovarian serous cancer.",MORAB-003 displays prominent antitumor activity in ovarian cancer models expressing FRα at high levels.

First trimester maternal serum IMA concentrations in those subsequently developing pre-term pre-eclampsia (n = 19) were compared to randomly chosen controls with normal pregnancy outcome (n = 69). Median first trimester serum IMA concentrations were significantly higher in women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia (median 126.5 kU/L, interquartile range (IQR) 114.33-134.36 kU/L) when compared to those with normal pregnancy outcome (median 115.01 kU/L, IQR 102.29-124.81 kU/L, P = 0.02).","Maternal serum IMA levels are elevated in the first trimester in women with pre-eclampsia, a clinical manifestation of defective endovascular trophoblast development. This suggests that abnormally high intrauterine hypoxia and subsequent reperfusion oxidative damage may be associated with defective trophoblast development. First trimester serum IMA may be a potential biomarker for abnormal placental development.",closed_qa
Is rapid gastric emptying more common than gastroparesis in patients with autonomic dysfunction?,"Autonomic dysfunction is associated with a wide variety of gastrointestinal symptoms. It is unclear how many patients with autonomic dysfunction have slow or rapid gastric emptying. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of rapid and delayed solid phase gastric emptying in patients with autonomic dysfunction referred for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms and the association of emptying rate with clinical symptoms. Retrospective review of all patients with autonomic dysfunction who had a gastric emptying test from January, 1996 to March, 2005. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, composite autonomic scoring scale (CASS) score, and gastric emptying parameters were analyzed. Sixty-one subjects (women 49, age 42 [16-74] yr) with autonomic dysfunction were reviewed. Patients had mild-to-moderate (mean CASS score 3) autonomic dysfunction. Twenty-seven, 17, and 17 patients had rapid, normal, and delayed gastric emptying t(1/2), respectively. In addition, 10 patients had initially rapid emptying in phase 1, with subsequent slowing in phase 2 to produce an overall normal or delayed t(1/2). There was no difference in demographic data or CASS score among the three groups. More patients with initial or overall rapid emptying had diarrhea (70%) compared to patients with normal (33%) or delayed (33%) emptying (P= 0.018).","Unexpectedly, more patients with autonomic dysfunction have rapid rather than delayed gastric emptying. The presence of diarrhea in patients with autonomic symptoms should prompt consideration for the presence of rapid gastric emptying. Conversely, the finding of rapid gastric emptying in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt consideration for the presence of underlying autonomic dysfunction.",closed_qa
Does conversion of high-response gonadotropin intrauterine insemination cycles to in vitro fertilization result in excellent ongoing pregnancy rates?,"To determine whether conversion of gonadotropin/IUI cycles at high risk of high-order multiple pregnancies to IVF yields a pregnancy rate high enough to warrant the added intervention. Case-control study. Brigham and Women's Hospital assisted reproductive technology program. Seventy-seven patients converted from gonadotropin/IUI to IVF, 77 consecutive age and attempt number-matched controls (sequential controls [SCs]), and 77 consecutive age-, attempt-, and E(2)-matched controls (E(2) controls [ECs]). Gonadotropin/IUI cycles with exuberant responses were converted to IVF (cases) to avoid cycle cancellation and high-order multiple pregnancies. Pregnancy rates, delivery rates, E(2) levels, follicle and oocyte number, and fertilization and implantation rates. Compared with SCs and ECs, cases had more follicles (16.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 13.3 +/- 0.9 and 14.4 +/- 0.9) and higher E(2) at hCG administration (1,951 +/- 93 vs. 1,568 +/- 96 and 1,939 +/- 89 pg/mL). Delivery rates among the three groups (45.5% vs. 32.5% and 39.0%) did not differ significantly. Despite the transfer of fewer embryos in cases than in controls (2.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.1 and 2.9 +/- 0.1), three triplet pregnancies occurred in cases and three in controls.",Conversion of high responder gonadotropin/IUI patients to IVF is an effective alternative to cycle cancellation and offers a delivery rate as high or higher per cycle than that of planned IVF. Sample size limited the statistical power of the study.,closed_qa
Do giardia lamblia infections become clinically evident by eliciting symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?,"Giardia lamblia infection is often asymptomatic. Its main, but not well understood, symptom is diarrhea. An outbreak of giardiasis in our town allowed us to test the hypothesis that patients with symptomatic infection are, actually, patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) exacerbated by giardiasis. We studied 100 patients with symptomatic giardiasis. Eighty-two of them were also affected by IBS, according to the ""Rome 1992 Criteria"". They were randomized in four groups, two of which (A and B), made up of 41 patients each, included the subjects with giardiasis and IBS, whereas the remaining two (C and D), made of up of 9 patients each, included subjects with giardiasis only. The groups A and C were treated with metronidazole, whereas groups B and D were treated with drugs commonly used for IBS, but inactive against the parasite. According to a single blind protocol, the treatment with metronidazole was ineffective in the groups with giardiasis and IBS. Instead, the treatment for IBS ameliorated the symptoms in these patients. On the contrary, the groups without IBS improved only with metronidazole.",The large majority of patients with symptomatic giardiasis are affected by IBS and are not cured by antiparasite treatment.,closed_qa
Is non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration associated with the metabolic syndrome among US youth aged 12-19 years?,"To test the hypothesis that the concentration of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in youth. Data on children and adolescents aged 12-19 years (n = 2734) from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 were analyzed. Depending on the definition of MetS used, the mean non-HDL-C concentration among youth with MetS ranged from 144.2 to 155.8 mg/dL, compared with 108.8-109.1 mg/dL in those without MetS (all P < .001). The MetS prevalence ranged from 6.9% to 11.7% in youth with a non-HDL-C concentration of 120-144 mg/dL and from 21.5% to 23.4% in those with a concentration ≥ 145 mg/dL-both significantly higher than the prevalence of 1.9%-3.4% in youth with a concentration <120 mg/dL (all P < .001). After adjustment for potential confounders, youth with a non-HDL-C concentration ≥ 120 mg/dL or ≥ 145 mg/dL were about 3 or 4 times more likely to have MetS compared with those with a non-HDL-C <120 mg/dL or <145 mg/dL (all P < .001).","Fasting non-HDL-C concentration was strongly associated with MetS in US youth. Our results support the use of non-HDL-C thresholds of 120 mg/dL and 145 mg/dL to indicate borderline and high MetS risk, respectively.",closed_qa
Is the mitochondrial genome of Globodera ellingtonae composed of two circles with segregated gene content and differential copy numbers?,"The evolution of animal mitochondrial (mt) genomes has resulted in a highly conserved structure: a single compact circular chromosome approximately 14 to 20 kb long. Within the last two decades exceptions to this conserved structure, such as the division of the genome into multiple chromosomes, have been reported in a diverse set of metazoans. We report on the two circle multipartite mt genome of a newly described cyst nematode, Globodera ellingtonae. The G. ellingtonae mt genome was found to be comprised of two circles, each larger than any other multipartite circular mt chromosome yet reported, and both were larger than the single mt circle of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The genetic content of the genome was disproportionately divided between the two circles, although they shared a ~6.5 kb non-coding region. The 17.8 kb circle (mtDNA-I) contained ten protein-coding genes and two tRNA genes, whereas the 14.4 kb circle (mtDNA-II) contained two protein-coding genes, 20 tRNA genes and both rRNA genes. Perhaps correlated with this division of genetic content, the copy number of mtDNA-II was more than four-fold that of mtDNA-I in individual nematodes. The difference in copy number increased between second-stage and fourth-stage juveniles.",The segregation of gene types to different mt circles in G. ellingtonae could provide benefit by localizing gene functional types to independent transcriptional units. This is the first report of both two-circle and several-circle mt genomes within a single genus. The differential copy number associated with this multipartite mt organization could provide a model system for deconstructing mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number both in somatic cells and during germline development.,closed_qa
Does berberine chloride mediate its anti-leishmanial activity via differential regulation of the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway in macrophages?,"A complex interplay between Leishmania and macrophages influences parasite survival and necessitates disruption of signaling molecules, eventually resulting in impairment of macrophage function. In this study, we demonstrate the immunomodulatory activity of Berberine chloride in Leishmania infected macrophages. The IC(50) of Berberine chloride, a quaternary isoquinoline alkaloid was tested in an amastigote macrophage model and its safety index measured by a cell viability assay. It eliminated intracellular amastigotes, the IC(50) being 2.8 fold lower than its IC(50) in promastigotes (7.10 µM vs. 2.54 µM) and showed a safety index >16. Levels of intracellular and extracellular nitric oxide (NO) as measured by flow cytometry and Griess assay respectively showed that Berberine chloride in Leishmania infected macrophages increased production of NO. Measurement of the mRNA expression of iNOS, IL-12 and IL-10 by RT-PCR along with levels of IL-12p40 and IL-10 by ELISA showed that in infected macrophages, Berberine chloride enhanced expression of iNOS and IL-12p40, concomitant with a downregulation of IL-10. The phosphorylation status of extracellular signal related kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was studied by western blotting. In infected macrophages, Berberine chloride caused a time dependent activation of p38 MAPK along with deactivation of ERK1/2; addition of a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 inhibited the increased generation of NO and IL-12p40 by Berberine chloride as also prevented its decrease of IL-10.","Berberine chloride modulated macrophage effector responses via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, highlighting the importance of MAPKs as an antiparasite target.",closed_qa
Does early Cumulative Supplemental Oxygen predict Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in High Risk Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns?,"To assess the prognostic accuracy of early cumulative supplemental oxygen (CSO) exposure for prediction of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death, and to evaluate the independent association of CSO with BPD or death. We performed a secondary analysis of the Trial of Late Surfactant, which enrolled 511 infants born at ≤28 weeks gestational age who were mechanically ventilated at 7-14 days of life. Our primary outcome was BPD or death at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, as determined by a physiological oxygen/flow challenge. Average daily supplemental oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen - 0.21) was calculated. CSO was calculated as the sum of the average daily supplemental oxygen over time periods of interest up to 28 days of age. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) values were generated to evaluate the accuracy of CSO for prediction of BPD or death. The independent relationship between CSO and BPD or death was assessed in multivariate modeling, while adjusting for mean airway pressure. In the study infants, mean gestational age at birth was 25.2 ± 1.2 weeks and mean birth weight was 700 ± 165 g. The AUROC value for CSO at 14 days was significantly better than that at earlier time points for outcome prediction (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.74); it did not increase with the addition of later data. In multivariate modeling, a CSO increase of 1 at 14 days increased the odds of BPD or death (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2; P < .0001), which corresponds to a 7% higher daily supplemental oxygen value.","In high-risk extremely low gestational age newborns, the predictive accuracy of CSO plateaus at 14 days. CSO is independently associated with BPD or death. This index may identify infants who could benefit from early intervention to prevent BPD.",closed_qa
Traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke: a delayed sequela?,"Although the conventional risk factors of ischemic stroke are numerous and the physiopathological mechanisms are well known, we believe that there may be other less common factors that have received less attention by researchers but are nonetheless just as important. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a long-term relationship between suffering severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the occurrence of ischemic stroke. A retrospective study was performed to examine 140 cases of severe TBI attended over the last 10 years and the delayed presentation (that is, more than a year later) of an ischemic stroke. A fundamental requirement was the absence of any other known risk factors and the location of the cerebral infarct had to be ipsilateral and adjacent to the injured area of the brain. Only three patients were detected who presented a late post-traumatic medium-sized stroke located in the cortico-subcortical region of the carotid territory, and who were diagnosed within an interval of time ranging between 11 and 16 months.","Based on the physiopathology put forward to account for the aetiological factors of diseases such as Parkinson, Alzheimer or post-traumatic epilepsy, we found reasons to consider severe TBI to be another predisposing factor of delayed ischemic stroke, with all the implications this involves in medical-legal matters. More extensive case mixes will be needed in order to confirm our proposition.",closed_qa
Is volume-based metabolic tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy associated with an increased risk of recurrence in breast cancer?,"To evaluate the prognostic value of a volume-based metabolic tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. This study was approved by the institutional review board, with waivers of informed consent. One hundred sixty-seven patients (mean age, 44 years; range, 22-68 years) with clinical stage II or III breast cancer who underwent fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans at baseline and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy between July 2006 and June 2013 were selected. The association between the metabolic response parameters and the disease-free survival was assessed by using a Cox proportional hazards regression model and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Metabolic response parameters included the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), the total metabolic tumor volume (MTVtotal), and the relative decrease in SUVmax and MTVtotal. In the Cox model, posttreatment SUVmax (P = .029) and MTVtotal (P = .028) and relative decreases in SUVmax (P = .032) and MTVtotal (P = .005) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were significantly associated with disease-free survival after adjusting for pretreatment clinical stage, yp stage, and tumor subtype. In the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, MTVtotal after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had the highest association with outcome compared with the other parameters (P < .001). MTVtotal of up to 0.2 cm(3) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with a favorable outcome in patients who did not achieve pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","The volume-based metabolic tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with an increased risk of recurrence, regardless of tumor subtype and pathologic tumor response.",closed_qa
Does [ Chemical components from essential oil of Pandanus amaryllifolius leave ]?,"To analyze the chemical compositions of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaves essential oil extracted by steam distillation. The essential oil of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaves was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrum, and the relative content of each component was determined by area normalization method. 128 peaks were separated and 95 compounds were identified, which weighed 97.75%.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiation and duration of chemotherapy before surgical resection for pancreatic cancer: does time interval between radiotherapy and surgery matter?,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation and chemotherapy provided for borderline or locally advanced, potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma improves resectability rates. Response to therapy is also an important prognostic factor. There are no data in the literature regarding optimal time interval or duration of chemotherapy after chemoradiation before surgery, and pathologic response rates. Using our database, we evaluated these relationships and the effect on overall and progression-free survival. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 83 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced, potentially resectable, and borderline resectable pancreatic cancers before definitive resection. We divided patients into three groups according to time interval between completion of chemoradiation and resection: group A (0-10 weeks), group B (11-20 weeks), and group C (>20 weeks). After chemoradiation, patients underwent ongoing chemotherapy before resection. Pathologic response was defined as major (>95% fibrosis), partial (50-94% fibrosis), or minor (<50% fibrosis). There were 56 patients in group A, 17 patients in group B, and 10 patients in group C. Patients in groups B and C were significantly more likely to experience a major response than group A (p<0.013). Patients in group C had significantly increased median progression-free and overall survival (p<0.05). Multivariable classification and regression tree analysis demonstrated pathologic response to be the only significant factor in overall survival.","Patients who underwent a prolonged time interval after neoadjuvant chemoradiation with ongoing chemotherapy were more likely to have an improved pathologic response at time of surgical resection, which was associated with improved median overall survival.",closed_qa
The post ACOSOG Z0011 era: does our new understanding of breast cancer really change clinical practice?,"The ACOSOG Z0011 trial (Z0011) expanded our thinking about breast cancer (BC) and showed that limited metastatic disease left behind in the axilla did not compromise oncological safety in a selected group of patients. The aim of the current study was to assess the potential impact of Z0011 on clinical practice by testing the applicability of its criteria to a European patient population. We reviewed a consecutive series of 389 sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) performed for invasive BC at the University Hospital Basel between 2003 and 2009 (65.6% of all surgically treated patients, n = 593). When compared to the axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) arm of Z0011, our patients had significantly less advanced LN involvement (≥ 3 LN: 8.5% vs. 21.0%, p = 0.048). Thirty-five patients (9.0%) met the Z0011 inclusion criteria and had 1-2 SLNs with macrometastases (5.9% of all surgically treated BC patients). If the inclusion criteria of Z0011 had been applied, a considerable number of LNs would have been missed in two cases (0.5% of all SLNBs).","The application of the Z0011 led to the omission of completion ALND in less than 10% of all SLNB procedures (<6% of all surgically treated BC patients); therefore, we do not think that the perception of Z0011 as ""practice changing"" is justified. On the other side, skeptics of the routine implementation of the Z0011 protocol may overestimate its potential hazards. When performing a thorough preoperative clinical axillary staging, the number of patients who would have been undertreated is minimal.",closed_qa
Is eGFR a reliable preoperative renal function parameter in patients with gastric cancer?,"To evaluate the validity of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a preoperative renal function parameter in patients with gastric cancer. A retrospective study was conducted in 147 patients with gastric cancer. Preoperative creatinine clearance (Ccr), eGFR, and pre- and postoperative serum creatinine (sCr) data were examined. Preoperative Ccr and eGFR were then compared for their reliability in predicting postoperative renal dysfunction. Among 110 patients with normal preoperative Ccr values, 7 (6.3%) had abnormal postoperative sCr values, and among 112 patients with normal preoperative eGFR values, postoperative sCr was abnormal in 5 (4.5%) (P = 0.53). Among 37 patients with abnormal preoperative Ccr values, 30 (81.1%) had normal postoperative sCr values, and of 35 patients with abnormal preoperative eGFR values, postoperative sCr was normal in 25 (71.4%) (P = 0.34). Preoperative Ccr was significantly correlated with eGFR (r = 0.514), and postoperative sCr was significantly correlated with preoperative Ccr (r = -0.334) and eGFR (r = -0.02).",Preoperative eGFR is as effective as Ccr for predicting postoperative renal dysfunction. eGFR should therefore be used as an indicator of preoperative renal function in place of Ccr since it is a cheaper and easier to perform test.,closed_qa
Does heparin-Binding Protein Measurement improve the Prediction of Severe Infection With Organ Dysfunction in the Emergency Department?,"Early identification of patients with infection and at risk of developing severe disease with organ dysfunction remains a difficult challenge. We aimed to evaluate and validate the heparin-binding protein, a neutrophil-derived mediator of vascular leakage, as a prognostic biomarker for risk of progression to severe sepsis with circulatory failure in a multicenter setting. A prospective international multicenter cohort study. Seven different emergency departments in Sweden, Canada, and the United States. Adult patients with a suspected infection and at least one of three clinical systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (excluding leukocyte count). None. Plasma levels of heparin-binding protein, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate, and leukocyte count were determined at admission and 12-24 hours after admission in 759 emergency department patients with suspected infection. Patients were defined depending on the presence of infection and organ dysfunction. Plasma samples from 104 emergency department patients with suspected sepsis collected at an independent center were used to validate the results. Of the 674 patients diagnosed with an infection, 487 did not have organ dysfunction at enrollment. Of these 487 patients, 141 (29%) developed organ dysfunction within the 72-hour study period; 78.0% of the latter patients had an elevated plasma heparin-binding protein level (>30 ng/mL) prior to development of organ dysfunction (median, 10.5 hr). Compared with other biomarkers, heparin-binding protein was the best predictor of progression to organ dysfunction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.80). The performance of heparin-binding protein was confirmed in the validation cohort.","In patients presenting at the emergency department, heparin-binding protein is an early indicator of infection-related organ dysfunction and a strong predictor of disease progression to severe sepsis within 72 hours.",closed_qa
Does failure to clear elevated lactate predict 24-hour mortality in trauma patients?,"Lactate clearance is a standard resuscitation goal in patients in nontraumatic shock but has not been investigated adequately as a tool to identify trauma patients at risk of dying. Our objective was to determine if trauma patients with impaired lactate clearance have a higher 24-hour mortality rate than patients whose lactate concentration normalizes. A retrospective chart review identified patients who were admitted directly from the scene of injury to an urban trauma center between 2010 and 2013 and who had at least one lactate concentration measurement within 24 hours. Transfers, patients without lactate measurement, and those who were dead on arrival were excluded. Of the 26,545 screened patients, 18,304 constituted the initial lactate measurement population, and 3,887 were the lactate clearance cohorts. Initial lactate had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 and 0.73 for mortality at 24 hours and in the hospital, respectively. An initial concentration of 3 mmol/L or greater had a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.73 for mortality at 24 hours. The mortality rate among patients with elevated lactate concentrations (n = 2,381; 5.6 [2.8] mmol/L) that did not decline to less than 2.0 mmol/L in response to resuscitative efforts (mean [SD] second measurement, 3.7 [1.9] mmol/L) was nearly seven times higher (4.1% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001) than among those with an elevated concentration (n = 1,506, 5.3 [2.7] mmol/L) that normalized (1.4 [0.4] mmol/L). Logistic regression analysis showed that failure to clear lactate was associated with death more than any other feature (odds ratio, 7.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-35.5), except having an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 25 (odds ratio, 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-25.2).",Failure to clear lactate is a strong negative prognostic marker after injury. An initial lactate measurement combined with a second measurement for high-risk individuals might constitute a useful method of risk stratifying injured patients.,closed_qa
Is the guideline for work-related medical rehabilitation successfully implemented?,"The guideline for work-related medical rehabilitation (WMR) in responsibility of the German Pension Insurance describes standards of work-related measures in medical rehabilitation. We investigated if contents and recommended amount of treatment were successfully implemented and which improvements were associated with the implementation. Implementation of the WMR guideline was evaluated at 7 inpatient orthopaedic rehabilitation centres. Patients completed questionnaires at beginning of rehabilitation, at dis-charge and 3 months after discharge. Details -regarding the treatments provided were extracted from the standardised discharge report. The recommended amount of social counselling and work-related psychosocial therapy measures were appropriate. However, there were discrepancies regarding the recommended amount of functional capacity training. The standardised mean difference (SMD) between baseline and 3-month follow-up sick leave duration indicated an almost medium-sized effect (SMD=0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.66). An additional 5 h of work-related therapy was associated with a 1.2-week decrease in sick leave duration (95% CI: -2.38 to -0.03).",The guideline was for the most part successfully implemented and sets important standards for the roll-out of WMR.

Does recurrent spontaneous hypoglycaemia cause loss of neurogenic and neuroglycopaenic signs in infants with congenital hyperinsulinism?,"Hypoglycaemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) with impaired neurogenic and neuroglycopaenic responses occurs in adults following recent, repeated hypoglycaemia. We aimed to evaluate whether HAAF also occurs in patients with infant-onset congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). A controlled fast was performed in (i) seven CHI infants with initial symptomatic hypoglycaemia and three recent episodes of spontaneous recurrent hypoglycaemia each lasting <5 min and in (ii) seven infants with idiopathic ketotic hypoglycaemia for control. At the time of hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <3 mmol/l or clinical signs), blood was drawn for serum insulin, cortisol, glucagon, adrenalin and nor-adrenalin. Signs of hypoglycaemia were documented. In CHI patients, the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were analysed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and/or direct bidirectional sequencing. Two CHI patients had a paternal ABCC8 mutation, five had no mutations. When repeated hypoglycaemia was provoked, all CHI patients exhibited a complete loss of clinical signs of hypoglycaemia, along with a global blunting of the counter-regulatory hormones cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, adrenalin and nor-adrenalin responses (median values 256 nmol/l, 23 pmol/l, 5·6 mU/l, 390 pmol/l and 2·9 nmol/l, respectively), irrespective of mutational status. In the controls, hypoglycaemia was always clinically overt with normal counter-regulatory cortisol, glucagon, adrenalin and nor-adrenalin responses (530 nmol/l, 60, 920 pmol/l and 4·0 nmol/l, respectively).","Recurrent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia even of short duration blunts the autonomic, neuroglycopaenic and glucose counter-regulatory hormonal responses in patients with infant-onset CHI resulting in clinically silent hypoglycaemia.

Does proteomic analysis reveal downregulation of housekeeping proteins in the diabetic vascular proteome?,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of death associated with cardiovascular complications. However, a complete understanding of protein changes within the diabetic vasculature is still lacking. Herein, we utilized mass spectrometry to perform vascular and urinary proteome analysis using a rat model of high-fat feeding and low-dose streptozotocin to simulate late-stage T2D. The purpose of this study was to identify aortic and urine proteins that are differentially expressed in normal and T2D rats. High-fat feeding and low-dose streptozotocin resulted in hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia and high levels of circulating free fatty acids. Using a shotgun proteomic approach, high-mobility-group protein B1 and spondin-1 were significantly increased in T2D aorta compared to control aorta, suggesting vascular inflammation and smooth muscle proliferation, respectively. However, the majority of differentially expressed aortic proteins were downregulated in T2D, including proteins associated with coagulation, cell differentiation and redox homeostasis. Strikingly, we report a significant downregulation of commonly used cytoskeletal housekeeping proteins in T2D aorta. Urine from T2D rats displayed increased expression of proteins involved in inflammation and oxidative stress and decreased expression of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and cell adhesion. A number of differentially expressed proteins in urine of T2D rats have previously been reported in human T2D, thereby supporting this animal model as a good representation of human T2D.",Our data offer new information regarding key pathways that could be therapeutically targeted to combat the cardiovascular complications of T2D.,closed_qa
Does discontinuation of furosemide decrease PaCO ( 2 ) in patients with COPD?,"To evaluate whether the discontinuation of furosemide treatment resulted in a decrease in PaCO(2) and an increase in daytime and nocturnal oxygenation. Furosemide is widely prescribed in patients with COPD for the treatment of peripheral edema. It is known that furosemide causes a metabolic alkalosis. A diminished chemoreceptor stimulation may cause a decreased alveolar ventilation. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Department of Pulmonology, Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem, the Netherlands. Twenty patients with stable COPD (10 men; median age, 70 years [range, 58 to 81 years]; FEV(1) 35% predicted [range, 19 to 70% predicted]). Subjects were included if they had received furosemide, 40 mg/d, for the treatment of peripheral edema for at least a month and if they had a mean nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) < 92%. Patients with cardiac left and/or right ventricular dysfunction, sleep apneas, and patients receiving other diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, potassium or chloride replacement therapy, or long-term oxygen treatment were excluded. Furosemide was discontinued for 1 week and replaced by placebo treatment in the first or the second week. Ventilation, daytime arterial blood gas levels, and nocturnal SaO(2) were measured at baseline, after 1, and after 2 weeks. Sixteen subjects completed the study. Ventilation increased from 10.4 L/min (range, 6.7 to 15.4 L/min) at baseline to 11.6 L/min (range, 8.7 to 14.0 L/min) after discontinuation of furosemide (p < 0.05). PaCO(2) decreased from 45 mm Hg (range, 35 to 64 mm Hg) to 41 mm Hg (range, 32 to 61 mm Hg; p < 0.01).

Does deregulation of cap-dependent mRNA translation increase tumour radiosensitivity through reduction of the hypoxic fraction?,"Tumour hypoxia is an important limiting factor in the successful treatment of cancer. Adaptation to hypoxia includes inhibition of mTOR, causing scavenging of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of preventing mTOR-dependent translation inhibition on hypoxic cell survival and tumour sensitivity towards irradiation. The effect of eIF4E-overexpression on cell proliferation, hypoxia-tolerance, and radiation sensitivity was assessed using isogenic, inducible U373 and HCT116 cells. We found that eIF4E-overexpression significantly enhanced proliferation of cells under normal conditions, but not during hypoxia, caused by increased cell death during hypoxia. Furthermore, eIF4E-overexpression stimulated overall rates of tumour growth, but resulted in selective loss of hypoxic cells in established tumours and increased levels of necrosis. This markedly increased overall tumour sensitivity to irradiation.",Our results demonstrate that hypoxia induced inhibition of translational control through regulation of eIF4E is an important mediator of hypoxia tolerance and radioresistance of tumours. These data also demonstrate that deregulation of metabolic pathways such as mTOR can influence the proliferation and survival of tumour cells experiencing metabolic stress in opposite ways of nutrient replete cells.,closed_qa
Is [ Coordination between primary and specialized care in gastroenterology insufficient . A survey of gastroenterologists and general practitioners ]?,"Collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and specialists is considered crucial to provide high-quality healthcare. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between gastroenterologists and GPs in regional hospitals and their referring primary care centers in Catalonia (Spain). A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was carried out using anonymous questionnaires between January and April 2008. A total of 314 surveys were administered (261 GPs and 53 gastroenterologists). The overall relationship was considered highly deficient or insufficient by 62.3% of gastroenterologists (95% CI, 47.9-74.9) and by 55.6% of GPs (95% CI, 49.3-61.7). More than half (56.6%) of the gastroenterologists did not know any GPs, or only a very few, and the situation was the same for 80.4% of GPs. Sixty-four percent of gastroenterologists considered that the quality of care for digestive diseases in primary care was highly deficient or insufficient while 21.1% of GPs considered that the care provided by gastroenterologists was highly deficient or insufficient. The perception of healthcare in both primary and specialized settings was substantially better when there was good interaction between gastroenterologists and GPs.","Practitioners acknowledge that the degree of interaction between different levels of healthcare is insufficient. Moreover, gastroenterologists consider that the management of digestive diseases in primary care is deficient. Establishing a personal relationship between the two types of practitioners substantially improves mutual assessment.",closed_qa
Does bretylium abolish neurotransmitter release without necessarily abolishing the nerve terminal action potential in sympathetic terminals?,"The antidysrhythmic bretylium is useful experimentally because it selectively abolishes neurotransmitter release from sympathetic peripheral nerve terminals. Its mechanism of action seemed settled, but recent results from optical monitoring of single terminals now suggests a new interpretation. Orthograde transport of a dextran-conjugated Ca(2+) indicator to monitor Ca(2+) in nerve terminals of mouse isolated vas deferens with a confocal microscope. In some experiments, local neurotransmitter release was detected by monitoring neuroeffector Ca(2+) transients (NCTs) in adjacent smooth muscles, a local measure of purinergic transmission. Sympathetic terminals were identified with catecholamine fluorescence (UV excitation) or post-experiment immunohistochemistry. Bretylium (10 microM) abolished NCTs at 60/61 junctions over the course of 2 h, indicating effective abolition of neurotransmitter release. However, bretylium did not abolish the field stimulus-induced Ca(2+) transient in most nerve terminals, but did increase both action potential delay (by 2+/-0.4 ms) and absolute refractory period (by 4+/-2 ms). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that 85-96% of terminals orthogradely filled with a dextran-conjugated fluorescent probe contained Neuropeptide Y (NPY). A formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde-induced catecholamine fluorescence (FAGLU) technique was modified to allow sympathetic terminals to be identified with a Ca(2+) indicator present. Most terminals contained catecholamines (based on FAGLU) or secrete ATP (as NCTs in adjacent smooth muscle cells are abolished).",Bretylium can inhibit neurotransmitter release downstream of Ca(2+) influx without abolishing the nerve terminal action potential. Bretylium-induced increases in the absolute refractory period permit living sympathetic terminals to be identified.,closed_qa
Is pannexin 3 required for late stage bone growth but not for initiation of ossification in avian embryos?,"Pannexin 3 (PANX3) is a channel-forming protein capable of stimulating osteogenesis in vitro. Here, we studied the in vivo roles of PANX3 in the chicken embryo using the RCAS retroviral system to over-express and knockdown expression during endochondral bone formation. In the limbs, PANX3 RNA was first detected in the cartilage condensations and became restricted to the prehypertrophic cartilage of the epiphyses, diaphysis, and perichondrium. The increase in PANX3 was not sufficient to alter osteogenesis; however, knockdown with a virus containing an interference RNA construct caused a 20% reduction in bone volume. The control virus containing an shEGFP cassette did not affect development. Interestingly, the phenotype was restricted to later stages rather than to proliferation of the skeletogenic mesenchyme, formation of the cartilage condensation, or creation of the hypertrophic zones. In addition, there was also no change in readouts of Hedgehog, WNT, fibroblast growth factor, or bone morphogenetic protein signaling using either quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or radioactive in situ hybridization.","Based on the normal expression domains of PANX3 and the relatively late manifestation of the phenotype, it is possible that PANX3 hemichannels may be required to facilitate the transition of hypertrophic chondrocytes to osteoblasts, thereby achieving final bone size.

Is cyclooxygenase-2 expression associated with vascular endothelial growth factor-C and lymph node metastases in human prostate cancer?,"Recent observations suggest an implication of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in tumor lymphangiogenesis through an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression. However, it is unclear whether COX-2 is also associated with VEGF-C expression, tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in human prostate cancer. COX-2 and VEGF-C expression were examined in tumor tissues from 58 prostate cancer patients using immunohistochemical staining. We also analyzed the association of COX-2 and VEGF-C expression with tumor lymphangiogenesis quantified as lymphatic vessel density (LVD), lymph node metastasis, and patients' biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS). High expression of either COX-2 or VEGF-C was correlated with tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis, as well as poor b-PFS. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between expression of COX-2 and VEGF-C (r = 0.631, p <0.001).","COX-2 is positively associated with VEGF-C expression, tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in prostate cancer. These findings suggest that COX-2 may play a pivotal role in lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer via the regulation of VEGF-C expression.",closed_qa
Is radioimmunoassay to detect antitransglutaminase autoantibodies the most sensitive and specific screening method for celiac disease?,"The aim of this study was to establish the most sensitive and specific screening method for celiac disease. We tested three methods based on different principles, which all detect autoantibodies against the same antigen (tissue transglutaminase). Sixty-two celiac children at the first biopsy (group 1), 78 celiac children on a gluten-free diet (group 2), 14 celiac children on a gluten-challenge (group 3), and 56 controls with a normal duodenal mucosa (group 4) were studied. The methods used were: 1) radioimmunoprecipitation assay using recombinant tissue transglutaminase (RIA); 2) commercial enzyme immunoassay using guinea pig tissue transglutaminase (ELISA); and 3) indirect immunofluorescence method for detection of antiendomysium antibodies (IF-EMA). RIA antitransglutaminase autoantibodies were detected in 100% of group 1, 43.6% of group 2, 100% of group 3, and none of the control subjects. ELISA antitransglutaminase autoantibodies were detected in 90.3% of group 1, 9% of group 2, 78.6% of group 3, and in none of the control subjects. IF-EMA were detected in 95.2% of group 1, 11.5% of group 2, 92.3% of group 3, and 1.8% of the controls.","Our results demonstrate a very high sensitivity and specificity of the RIA method to detect antitransglutaminase autoantibodies in comparison to ELISA and IF-EMA assays. We can explain this finding with the use of human recombinant antigen and the increased capacity of the RIA method to detect low titers of autoantibodies. If our data are confirmed by studies on larger series, tissue transglutaminase RIA could be proposed as the best screening method for celiac patients.",closed_qa
Does palliative chemotherapy improve survival in metastatic esophageal cancer?,"The role of chemotherapy in metastatic esophageal carcinoma (MEC) remains a matter of debate. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the survival impact of chemotherapy after stratification for prognostic factors. Consecutive patients with MEC (1995 to 2008) were randomly assigned to a development (n = 171) and a validation cohort (n = 113). We had first identified prognostic factors using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods in the development cohort and then validated them in the validation cohort. Then, we analyzed the impact of chemotherapy after stratification for these prognostic factors. The majority of patients had squamous cell carcinoma (80%). The Cox model has retained 2 prognostic factors only: associated cancers (hazard ratio = 2.77, range 1.39-5.54, p = 0.004) and grade 3-4 dysphagia (hazard ratio = 1.44, range 1.08-2.14, p = 0.007). Median survival was 10.9 in patients with 0 (n = 77), 6.2 in those with 1 (n = 65) and 1.8 months in those with 2 prognostic factors (n = 11/171; p = 0.025). The median survival times of the patients with 0, 1 and 2 prognostic factors were 13 versus 9 months (nonsignificant, NS), 6 versus 5 months (NS) and 5 versus 1.3 months (NS) in patients with and without chemotherapy, respectively.","Our data suggest that chemotherapy has no significant effect on survival for unselected MEC patients, regardless of the prognostic factors we identified.",closed_qa
Is alemtuzumab as consolidation after a response to fludarabine effective in purging residual disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,"Treatment with alemtuzumab has resulted in negative responses for minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In a prior analysis we demonstrated that it is possible to achieved MRD negativity, as assessed by polyclonality of immunoglobulin heavy chain after consolidation with alemtuzumab. This phase II study evaluated 34 patients with CLL who received alemtuzumab consolidation in an effort to improve the quality of their response to fludarabine-based induction. Subsequent peripheral blood stem-cell (PBSC) collection and transplantation, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics also were assessed. Thirty-four patients younger than 65 years who had a clinical response to fludarabine-based induction therapy received alemtuzumab 10 mg subcutaneously three times per week for 6 weeks. PBSCs were collected after mobilization with cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics study were taken between days 1 and 31. The complete response rate improved from 35% after fludarabine induction to 79.4% after alemtuzumab consolidation, including 19 patients (56%) who achieved MRD negativity. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions and fever. Cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred in 18 patients, all of whom were successfully treated with oral ganciclovir. PBSC collection was successful in 24 (92%) of 26 patients, and 18 patients underwent autologous PBSC transplantation. Alemtuzumab plasma concentrations increased gradually during the first 2 weeks and accumulated more rapidly thereafter.","Subcutaneously administered alemtuzumab was effective, safe, and well tolerated as consolidation therapy in patients with CLL who responded to fludarabine induction therapy. Subsequent PBSCT was feasible thereafter.",closed_qa
Is administration of 75 mg of aspirin daily for 28 days sufficient prophylaxis against renal transplant vein thrombosis?,"Early postoperative renal transplant vein thrombosis results in graft loss. We evaluate the effect of administering aspirin 75 mg daily for 28 days following transplantation. Prospectively collected data on the outcome of all transplants undertaken in our unit in the five-year period from January 1997 to January 2002 were reviewed, and in cases of graft failure before three months the cause was defined. In the study period, a total of 401 transplants were undertaken (311 cadaveric and 90 living related). There was one case of renal transplant vein thrombosis (0.25%). This represents a significant reduction on the unit's historical incidence of 5.8%, P < 0.001.",Aspirin 75 mg daily is adequate to virtually abolish renal transplant vein thrombosis and has a role in thromboprophylaxis in other situations where heparin is contraindicated.,closed_qa
Contemporary ceramic total hip arthroplasty in patients with cerebral palsy: does it work?,"Adult patients with cerebral palsy (CP), who have advanced degenerative arthritis of the hip, have been treated with resection arthroplasty and arthrodesis. Although total hip arthroplasty (THA) has also been used as one of the alternative options, there are few studies on contemporary bearings used in THA. Therefore, we evaluated the results of the contemporary ceramic-on-ceramic THA in adult patients with CP. From January 2005 to December 2007, five adult CP patients (5 hips) underwent THA using contemporary ceramic-on-ceramic bearings. All patients were able to stand or ambulate with intermittent use of assistive devices at home. We retrospectively reviewed the series to determine the results of THA in terms of pain relief, improved function, and durability of prosthesis. There were 3 men and 2 women with a mean age of 35.9 years. All patients had pain relief without decline in mobility postoperatively. One hip was dislocated, which was treated successfully with closed reduction and an abduction brace for 2 months. There was no ceramic fracture, loosening, or osteolysis during the mean follow-up of 6.8 years (range, 5.8 to 8.3 years).",Cementless THA using contemporary ceramic-on-ceramic bearings is a useful option for the treatment of advanced degenerative arthritis of the hip in ambulatory adults with CP.,closed_qa
Do advanced cardiac life support drugs increase resuscitation rates from in-hospital cardiac arrest?,"The benefit of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) medications during cardiac resuscitation is uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of these medications increased resuscitation from in-hospital cardiac arrest. A prospective cohort of patients undergoing cardiac arrest in 1 of 5 academic hospitals was studied. Patient and arrest factors related to resuscitation outcome were recorded. We determined the association of the administration of ACLS drugs (epinephrine, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium, lidocaine, and bretylium) with survival at 1 hour after resuscitation. Seven hundred seventy-three patients underwent cardiac resuscitation, with 269 (34. 8%) surviving for 1 hour. Use of epinephrine, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium, and lidocaine was associated with a decreased chance of successful resuscitation (P<.001 for all except lidocaine, P<.01). While controlling for significant patient factors (age, gender, and previous cardiac or respiratory disease) and arrest factors (initial cardiac rhythm, and cause of arrest), multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant association between unsuccessful resuscitation and the use of epinephrine (odds ratio . 08 [95% confidence interval .04-.14]), atropine (.24 [.17-.35]), bicarbonate (.31 [.21-.44]), calcium (.32 [.18-.55]), and lidocaine (.48 [.33-.71]). Drug effects did not improve when patients were grouped by their initial cardiac rhythm. Cox proportional hazards models that controlled for significant confounders demonstrated that survivors were significantly less likely to receive epinephrine (P<. 001) or atropine (P<.001) throughout the arrest.",We found no association between standard ACLS medications and improved resuscitation from in-hospital cardiac arrest. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether other therapies can improve resuscitation from cardiac arrest when compared with the presently used ACLS drugs.,closed_qa
Is systemic inflammation in unstable angina the result of myocardial necrosis?,"We investigated whether the source of the acute phase response in unstable angina (UA) lay within the culprit coronary plaque or distal myocardium. An inflammatory response is an important component of the acute coronary syndromes. However, its origin and mechanism remain unclear. In 94 stable patients undergoing coronary angiography, the relationship between systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and extent of atherosclerosis was studied. The temporal relationship between these markers and troponin T (TnT) was determined in 91 patients with UA. Cytokine levels were measured in the aortic root and coronary sinus of 36 unstable patients. There was no relationship found between stable coronary atherosclerosis and inflammatory marker levels. Compared with this group, admission levels of IL-6 (3.6 +/- 0.3 ng/ml vs. 10.7 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, p < 0.05) and CRP (2.3 +/- 0.1 mg/l vs. 4.6 +/- 0.6 mg/l, p < 0.05) were elevated in patients with UA. In this group, IL-6 and CRP remained elevated in those who subsequently experienced major adverse cardiac events. This inflammatory response occurred in parallel to the appearance of TnT. Both TNF-alpha (19.2 +/- 3.4 ng/ml vs. 17.1 +/- 3.3 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (10.3 +/- 1.4 ng/ml vs. 7.7 +/- 1.1 ng/ml, p < 0.01) were elevated in the coronary sinus compared with aortic root in patients with UA. This was principally observed in those who were TnT positive. There was no cytokine gradient across the culprit plaque.",There is an intracardiac inflammatory response in UA that appears to be the result of low-grade myocardial necrosis.

Does a three generations nation-wide population study of family load estimate in bipolar disorder with different age at onset?,"This nation-wide register-based study investigates how often bipolar disorder (BD) occurs in affected families compared to control families by estimating the family load as a random effect; this effect measures the degree of dependence among family members in relation to BD. Furthermore, the study addresses the impact of certain risk factors, namely, sex, age at onset of BD, degree of urbanization, year of birth, month of birth, and maternal and paternal age at birth. A total of N=1204 children and adolescent psychiatric cases born between 1950 and 1997 and registered in the Danish Central Psychiatric Register (DPCR) developed BD before the age of 58 years. N=3553 controls without any psychiatric diagnosis were matched for age, gender, and region of residence. Psychiatric diagnoses were also obtained on the relatives, e.g. parents, siblings, and offspring as a part of the Danish Three Generation Study (3GS). A family component was obtained by using different regression models. Familial factors accounted for 20% of the variation in disease outcome when controlling for year and month of birth, sex, and degree of urbanization. Only female sex was associated with an increased hazard ratio of BD. Also having a mother, father or a sibling with the disorder was proven to be a significant risk factor. Furthermore, case relatives did not develop BD earlier than control relatives.",These findings based on a very large and representative dataset provide further and very solid evidence for the high family aggregation of BD.,closed_qa
Does acetaminophen potentiate staurosporine-induced death in a human neuroblastoma cell line?,"Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumour in infants characterized by a high resistance to apoptosis. Recently, the cyclo-oxygenase pathway has been considered a potential target in the treatment of different kinds of tumours. The aim of the present work was to investigate a possible relationship between cyclo-oxygenase pathway and stauroporine-induced apoptosis in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Cellular viability was measured by release of LDH. DNA fragmentation was visualized by electrophoresis on agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Cyclo-oxygenase activity was measured in microsomal fractions obtained from cells by quantification of its final product PGE2 by RIA. Caspase-3 activity was measured fluorimetrically and Western blot analysis was performed to assess cytochrome c expression. We have found that staurosporine (500 nM) induced cellular death in a time-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Cyclo-oxygenase enzymatic activity was present in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells under basal conditions and pharmacological experiments using COX inhibitors indicate that cyclo-oxygenase-1 and cyclo-oxygenase-3 are the active isoforms in these cells. Co-incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with staurosporine (500 nM) and acetaminophen for 24 h potentiated staurosporine-mediated cellular death in a concentration-dependent manner. This process is mediated by an increase in cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation and is prevented by N-acetylcysteine or the superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP.",Acetaminophen potentiates staurosporine-mediated neuroblastoma cell death. The mechanism of action of acetaminophen seems to be related to production of reactive oxygen species and decreased intracellular glutathione levels.,closed_qa
Are plasma and urinary sex hormones differently related to lipids in healthy postmenopausal women?,"Endogenous sex hormones can be measured in plasma and urine. We determined the extent to which these two methods provide different information on hormonal status by relating them to lipid profile in postmenopausal women. Thirty healthy postmenopausal women collected one 24-h urine sample and a blood sample was taken. Urinary estrone (UE), plasma estrone (PE) and serum lipids were measured. Sex hormone levels were measured with specific radioimmunoassays. Linear regression analysis was used to determine associations between estrone levels and lipids. Results are presented as beta-coefficients in mmol/l per standard deviation (SD) of endogenous estrone levels, adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and smoking (95% confidence interval). A stratified analysis for obese (BMI> or =27 kg/m(2)) versus lean women was performed. Mean levels of endogenous sex hormones were (SD): PE, 90.1 pmol/l (37.3); and UE, 7757 pmol/24 h (2659). PE showed significant associations with HDL-cholesterol (0.18 mmol/l, 95% CI: 0.06; 0.30), triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/l, 95% CI: -0.49; -0.009) and very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL-cholesterol) (-0.11 mmol/l, 95% CI: -0.22; -0.003), but not with total and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol). UE was inversely associated with total (-0.41 mmol/l, 95% CI: -0.85; 0.02) and LDL-cholesterols (-0.42 mmol/l, 95% CI: -0.83; -0.005), but not with HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol. All associations appeared to be stronger in lean women.","Both plasma and UE levels appear to be associated to serum lipids in healthy postmenopausal women.

Is fas mRNA expression in blood reduced during episodes of human corneal graft rejection?,"Our purpose is to examine levels of Fas mRNA expression in blood during human corneal transplant rejection. Fas mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription-PCR in blood from normal controls, corneal recipients at the time of transplantation and during episodes of rejection. Samples taken at the time of a corneal rejection episode showed Fas mRNA levels were significantly lower in these patients than either normal controls (P = 0.017) or corneal transplant recipients not undergoing graft rejection (P = 0.00052). Serial samples from five patients who suffered an episode of rejection showed that the level of Fas mRNA is reduced during the rejection episode and subsequently recovers.",These results indicate low levels of Fas mRNA in blood may have a role in corneal transplant rejection.,closed_qa
Is partial compliance with antipsychotic medication common in patients with schizophrenia?,"Partial compliance with antipsychotic medication increases relapse and rehospitalization rates in patients with schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to assess the frequency of and factors contributing to partial compliance. During a 10 day period in June 2004 psychiatrists working in hospitals or in private practices in Germany were asked to participate in a compliance survey. Physicians were requested to evaluate the compliance in 10 patients with schizophrenia using a questionnaire consisting of 10 questions. The frequency of unintentional and intentional partial compliance as well as patient-related contributing factors were assessed. Unintentional partial compliance was defined as the lack of drug intake on any day during the past month. Demographic data of participants were collected. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and generalized estimation equation models. The psychiatrists (n=699) regarded 68% of the evaluated patients (n=5729) as unintentionally partially compliant within the last month. Sixty-nine per cent of the patients were considered intentionally partially compliant in the past. The most frequently assessed patient-related factors contributing to the partial compliance were lack of insight into the need for prophylactic medication (68%), lack of insight/denial of illness (66%/63%), feeling embarrassed at taking medication every day (62%), needing someone to remind them to take their medication (62%), cognitive problems (55%), and living conditions inappropriate for compliance (46%).","Partial compliance is a common problem in schizophrenia. Strategies to improve partial compliance derived from the contributing factors identified in the present study may include regular telephone reminders by case managers or families, adequate support in the patients' environment, use of dosette boxes, rationalizing drug regimens (e.g. once-daily dosage, monotherapy, depot medication), and psychoeducation.",closed_qa
Textured saline-filled breast implants for augmentation mammaplasty: does overfilling prevent deflation?,"Augmentation mammaplasty is the second most commonly performed aesthetic operation. Since the moratorium on gel-filled devices in 1992, saline-filled devices have become the prosthesis of choice in the United States. Although inflatable breast implants have been available since 1965, high rates of complete implant deflation have been reported. In this retrospective study, the authors highlight the effect of filling volume on the incidence of implant deflation, other implant-related trade-offs, and implant survival. Forty-nine women who had undergone aesthetic augmentation mammaplasty were followed up for up to 139 months. Twelve implants were underfilled (group 1), 47 devices were filled within the recommended volume (group 2), and 37 implants were overfilled beyond the manufacturer's maximum recommended volume (group 3). All the implants used were of the same type and from the same manufacturer (Siltex by Mentor, 2600). Through an inframammary approach, subpectoral placement of the device was used exclusively. Nineteen women experienced complete deflation of their implants, with an overall implant complete deflation rate of 19.79 percent. This complication occurred in 16.6 percent of group 1 patients, 21.2 percent of group 2, and 18.9 percent of group 3. Skin wrinkling and rippling were encountered in 50 percent of group 1, 29.78 percent of group 2, and 43.2 percent of group 3, with an overall incidence of 37.5 percent. In this series, the authors could not find a protective effect of overfilling on complete deflation (p = 0.925) nor on the avoidance of rippling and wrinkling (p = 0.285). Moreover, overfilling by more than 25 ml beyond the maximum recommended dose showed no statistical significance for the frequency of complete deflation (p = 0.982) or for the incidence of wrinkling and rippling (p = 0.828). However, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that overfilling the implants prolonged their longevity and had a statistically significant effect on the implants' 10-year survival rate. Of the 49 women, 34 (69.3 percent) needed a secondary surgical procedure, mainly for complete deflation (38.7 percent) and skin wrinkling/rippling (20.4 percent). At the end of the current study, eight of 49 women, representing 15 implants, retained their original implants for more than 120 months.",Use of Mentor 2600 prostheses for aesthetic breast augmentation led to a very high incidence of complete deflation and skin wrinkling and a high reoperation rate. Filling the implants within the recommended range or overfilling them increased device longevity and had a statistically significant effect on the implants' 10-year survival rate.,closed_qa
Do construction and validation of a preliminary Chinese version of the Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale?,"The development, validation, and psychometric properties of the Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale (WFPTS)-equivalent instrument for Chinese patients were investigated. We approached 3442 randomly selected outpatients at 3 Shanghai (China) general hospitals, treated ≥2 times per year by the same physician, for participation between November 2008 and December 2008. A Chinese version of the WFPTS (C-WFPTS) was prepared and administered to eligible and consenting patients, and subjected to validity assessment using 5 patient behaviors: (1) recommendation of the physician; (2) occurrence of dispute; (3) seeking a second opinion; (4) treatment adherence; and (5) consideration of switching physicians. A total of 352 (M: F, 149: 203; mean age, 40.67±17.31 years; age range, 14-94 years) consenting and eligible patients were included in the analysis. The unidimensionality and internal consistency of C-WFPTS was confirmed (Cronbach's α=0.833). Physician trust correlated significantly with physician satisfaction (r=0.73, P<0.001) and all 5 behaviors (1: r=0.453, 2: r=0.209, 3: r=0.406, 4: r=0.444, 5: r=0.471; P<0.001 for all), indicating validity and predictive validity, respectively. Patient trust increased significantly with increasing age and physician visits (P>0.05), but was not related to gender, birthplace, or insurance type.","C-WFPTS has good psychometric properties, reliability, and validity for the evaluation of patient trust in the patient-physician relationship, and thereby provides an essential tool for the characterization of patient-physician relationships in China, which is necessary for healthcare reform.",closed_qa
Is reduced expression of transcription factor AP-2α associated with gastric adenocarcinoma prognosis?,"This study aims to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of activator protein 2α (AP-2α) in gastric adenocarcinoma. AP-2α expression was analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining methods on tissue samples from a consecutive series of 481 gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent resections between 2003 and 2006. The relationship between AP-2α expression, clinicopathological factors, and patient survival was investigated. RT- qPCR results showed that the expression of AP-2α mRNA was reduced in tumor tissue samples, compared with expression in matched adjacent non-tumor tissue samples (P = 0.009); this finding was confirmed by western blotting analysis (P = 0.012). Immunohistochemical staining data indicated that AP-2α expression was significantly decreased in 196 of 481 (40.7%) gastric adenocarcinoma cases; reduced AP-2α expression was also observed in patients with poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.001) and total gastric carcinomas (P = 0.002), as well as in patients who underwent palliative tumor resection (P = 0.004). Additionally, reduced expression of AP-2α was more commonly observed in tumors that were staged as T4a/b (P = 0.018), N3 (P = 0.006), and M1 (P = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that reduced expression of AP-2α was associated with poor prognosis in gastric adenocarcinoma patients (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis identified AP-2α expression as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR = 1.512, 95% CI = 1.127-2.029, P = 0.006).",Our data suggest that AP-2α plays an important role in tumor progression and that reduced AP-2α expression independently predicts an unfavorable prognosis in gastric adenocarcinoma patients.,closed_qa
Magnetic resonance imaging retinal oximetry: a quantitative physiological biomarker for early diabetic retinopathy?,"To assess the efficacy of using magnetic resonance imaging measurements of retinal oxygenation response to detect early diabetic retinopathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted during 100% oxygen inhalation in patients with Type 2 diabetes with either no diabetic retinopathy (n = 12) or mild to moderate background diabetic retinopathy (n = 12), as well as in healthy control subjects (n = 12). Meanwhile, changes in retinal oxygenation response were measured. In the healthy control group, levels of retinal oxygenation response increased slowly during 100% oxygen inhalation. In contrast, they increased more quickly and attained homeostasis much earlier in the groups with background diabetic retinopathy (at the 20-min time point) and with no diabetic retinopathy (at the 25-min time point) than in the healthy control group (at the 42-min time point). Furthermore, levels of retinal oxygenation response in the group with background diabetic retinopathy increased more than that of the group with no diabetic retinopathy, which in turn increased more than that of the healthy control group. There are statistically significant differences between the group with background diabetic retinopathy and the healthy control group at 6-, 8-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 25-min time points (P<0.05). According to the normal range of the healthy control group by setting fundus photography results as 'gold standard' in our research, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and receiver operating characteristic area for reporting the early indications of utility of diabetic retinopathy were 83.33%, 58.33%, 50%, 87.5% and 0.774, respectively.",The results indicate that magnetic resonance imaging is a potential screening method and probably a quantitative physiological biomarker to find early diabetic retinopathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes.,closed_qa
Are methadone doses of 100 mg or greater more effective than lower doses at suppressing heroin self-administration in opioid-dependent volunteers?,"Methadone maintenance has been an effective pharmacotherapy for the treatment of heroin dependence for nearly four decades. Recent clinical research suggests that methadone doses larger than those used in most clinics are more effective at suppressing illicit heroin use. This greater efficacy may result from greater cross-tolerance to the reinforcing effects of heroin. The purpose of this double-blind, within-subject study was to examine the relationship between methadone maintenance dose and the reinforcing effects of heroin. Participants were stabilized on 50, 100 and 150 mg methadone (ascending order) during separate outpatient periods before being admitted to an inpatient research unit for testing at each maintenance dose. Five opiate-dependent volunteers completed the study. During each 4-week inpatient testing period, participants sampled three doses of heroin (0, 10, or 20 mg; random order; one dose per week) and were subsequently allowed seven opportunities to choose between another injection of that week's heroin dose and varying amounts of money (dollars 2-38). The number of heroin injections chosen decreased as methadone dose was increased. Larger alternative monetary reinforcers were required to suppress heroin self-administration during maintenance on 50 compared to 100 or 150 mg methadone. Larger methadone doses also completely blocked the subjective effects of heroin and produced greater withdrawal suppression during the outpatient periods.",These results support other clinical and laboratory-based research indicating that persistent heroin use may be reduced by providing larger methadone maintenance doses that produce more effective cross-tolerance to heroin.,closed_qa
Does an age-dependent ABO discrepancy between mother and baby reveal a novel A ( weak ) allele?,"Discrepancies in ABO grouping arise due to different reasons, posing a threat to patient safety. Underlying causes include mixed-field agglutination after transfusion, chimerism, fetomaternal exchange, or inheritance of unusual alleles resulting in weak A/B antigen expression. Cord blood from the infant of a group A2 B mother typed as group O, H+. Samples were investigated to elucidate this conundrum. Genomic DNA was analyzed by ABO genotyping and sequencing. Red blood cells (RBCs) were characterized by routine serology and flow cytometry. Glycosyltransferase structure was predicted with 3D-modeling software. The mother genotyped as ABO*A1.01/B.01, and the baby, ABO*A1.01/O.01.01. Sequencing revealed a substitution, 311T>A, in the ABO*A1-like allele, which predicts Ile104Asn. Flow cytometry demonstrated A antigen on the mother's RBCs equivalent to the A2 phenotype while no A was detectable on cord RBCs. However, blood from the 11-month-old child demonstrated markedly increased A expression, likely reflecting initiation of carbohydrate chain branching.","We unraveled a novel A(weak) allele (ABO*AW.29) in a case of apparent nonmaternity. Residue 104 is far from the catalytic site and may be involved in stabilizing the glycosyltransferase by dimerization. Our data support that the group AB mother's B-transferase stabilizes the altered A-transferase by heterodimerization, exemplifying the allelic enhancement phenomenon.",closed_qa
Does side of pupillary mydriasis predict the cognitive prognosis in patients with severe traumatic brain injury?,"Pupils' abnormalities are associated to bad prognosis in traumatic brain injury. We investigated the association between the side of pupil mydriasis and the long-term cognitive performance of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We analyzed the cognitive performance of patients admitted at the intensive care unit with isochoric pupils (IP, n = 28), left mydriasis (LM, n = 10), right mydriasis (RM, n = 9) evaluated in mean 2.5 years after the severe TBI and controls (n = 26) matched for age, sex and education level. Patients and controls had similar scores in the four WAIS-III investigated subtests. In comparison with controls, LM patients had lower scores in Letters and Category Fluency and IP patients in Category Fluency. Among the 10 evaluated memory tests, LM patients had lower scores than controls in eight, RM patients in two and IP in three memory tests. IP and RM were 3.5 to nine times more associated to significant impairment (cognitive scores under the percentile 10 of controls) in six of 16 investigated cognitive tests. LM was six to 15 times more associated to significant impairment in 10 of 16 cognitive tests. The association among the pupil abnormalities and cognitive performances remained significant after the multiple linear regression analysis controlling for age, gender, admission coma Glasgow scale and serum glucose, presence of associated trauma, and cranial computed tomography abnormalities.",Side of admission pupil abnormalities may be a useful variable to improve prognostic models for long-term cognitive performance in severe TBI patients.,closed_qa
Are the peripheral perfusion index and transcutaneous oxygen challenge test predictive of mortality in septic patients after resuscitation?,"The peripheral perfusion index (PI) is a noninvasive numerical value of peripheral perfusion, and the transcutaneous oxygen challenge test (OCT) is defined as the degree of transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (PtcO2) response to 1.0 FiO2. The value of noninvasive monitoring peripheral perfusion to predict outcome remains to be established in septic patients after resuscitation. Moreover, the prognostic value of PI has not been investigated in septic patients. Forty-six septic patients, who were receiving PiCCO-Plus cardiac output monitoring, were included in the study group. Twenty stable postoperative patients were studied as a control group. All the patients inspired 1.0 of FiO2 for 10 minutes during the OCT. Global hemodynamic variables, traditional metabolic variables, PI and OCT related-variables were measured simultaneously at 24 hours after PiCCO catheter insertion. We obtained the 10 min-OCT ((PtcO2 after 10 minutes on inspired 1.0 oxygen)--(baseline PtcO2)), and the oxygen challenge index ((10 min-OCT)/(PaO2 on inspired 1.0 oxygen--baseline PaO2)) during the OCT. The PI was significantly correlated with baseline PtcO2, 10 min-OCT and oxygen challenge index (OCI) in all the patients. The control group had a higher baseline PtcO2, 10 min-OCT and PI than the septic shock group. In the sepsis group, the macro hemodynamic parameters and ScvO2 showed no differences between survivors and nonsurvivors. The nonsurvivors had a significantly lower PI, 10 min-OCT and OCI, and higher arterial lactate level. The PI, 10 min-OCT and OCI predicted the ICU mortality with an accuracy that was similar to arterial lactate level. A PI<0.2 and a 10 min-OCT<66 mmHg were related to poor outcome after resuscitation.",The PI and OCT are predictive of mortality for septic patients after resuscitation. Further investigations are required to determine whether the correction of an impaired level of peripheral perfusion may improve the outcome of septic shock patients.,closed_qa
Do people recognise mental illness?,"Mental health literacy has been defined as the public's knowledge and the beliefs about mental disorders enhancing the ability to recognise specific disorders. Firstly, to determine whether the public recognises a person depicted in a vignette as mentally ill or as experiencing a crisis. Secondly, to reveal the factors influencing the correct recognition. Multiple logistic regression analysis of an opinion survey conducted in a representative population sample in Switzerland (n=844). The depression vignette was correctly recognised by 39.8% whereas 60.2% of the respondents considered the person depicted as having a 'crisis.' The schizophrenia vignette was correctly identified by 73.6% of the interviewees. A positive attitude to psychopharmacology positively influenced the recognition of the two vignettes whereas a positive attitude to community psychiatry had the inverse effect. Moreover, for the depression vignette previous contact to mentally ill people had a positive influence on the recognition. For the schizophrenia vignette instead, rigidity and interest in mass media had a negative influence, respectively.","The low knowledge about mental disorders, particularly depression, confirms the importance and the need to increase mental health literacy. Furthermore, professionals must openly discuss illness models with their patients, especially emphasising the differences between illness and crisis.",closed_qa
Does edaravone protect PC12 cells from ischemic-like injury via attenuating the damage to mitochondria?,"Edaravone had been validated to effectively protect against ischemic injuries. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of edaravone by observing the effects on anti-apoptosis, regulation of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression and recovering from damage to mitochondria after OGD (oxygen-glucose deprivation)-reperfusion. Viability of PC12 cells which were injured at different time of OGD injury, was quantified by measuring MTT (2-(4,5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) staining. In addition, PC12 cells' viability was also quantified after their preincubation in different concentration of edaravone for 30 min followed by (OGD). Furthermore, apoptotic population of PC12 cells that reinsulted from OGD-reperfusion with or without preincubation with edaravone was determined by flow cytometer analysis, electron microscope and Hoechst/PI staining. Finally, change of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression was detected by Western blot. (1) The viability of PC12 cells decreased with time (1 - 12 h) after OGD. We regarded the model of OGD 2 h, then replacing DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) for another 24 h as an OGD-reperfusion in this research. Furthermore, most PC12 cells were in the state of apoptosis after OGD-reperfusion. (2) The viability of PC12 cells preincubated with edaravone at high concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01 micromol/L) increased significantly with edaravone protecting PC12 cells from apoptosis after OGD-reperfusion injury. (3) Furthermore, edaravone attenuates the damage of OGD-reperfusion on mitochondria and regulated Bcl-2/Bax protein imbalance expression after OGD-reperfusion.",Neuroprotective effects of edaravone on ischemic or other brain injuries may be partly mediated through inhibition of Bcl-2/Bax apoptotic pathways by recovering from the damage of mitochondria.,closed_qa
Does albuminuria correlate with hemolysis and NAG and KIM-1 in patients with sickle cell anemia?,"Although hyperfiltration and albuminuria are common pathological conditions, kidney injury (KI) biomarkers have been seldom studied in individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA). We undertook a cross-sectional assessment of urine KI biomarkers in children and adults with SCA with and without albuminuria and a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Albumin, KI molecule 1 (KIM-1), N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were measured. Assays were normalized by urine creatinine. Urine intracellular hemosiderin and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were assessed as markers of hemolysis. Albuminuria was associated to the biomarkers by Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. Differences between the albuminuria (yes, no) groups were assessed by the t test. Nineteen patients with albuminuria (mean urine albumin/creatinine 527.14 ± 1070 mg/g, range 38.3--190 mg/g) and 19 patients without albuminuria (mean urine albumin/creatinine 15.93 ± 5.17 mg/g, range 7.9-28.4 mg/g) were studied. The age range for the whole group was 11-48 years, and 47 % were males. Patients with albuminuria were older, had lower hematocrit, were more likely to test positive for urine hemosiderin and had a higher KIM-1 (P = 0.0035) and NAG/ creatinine ratios (P = 0.0062). Urine hemosiderin strongly correlated to a higher LDH level (P < 0.001).","Despite a normal or increased eGFR, KI biomarkers were detected in the urine of individuals with SCA. NAG, KIM-1 and urine hemosiderin correlated with the presence of albuminuria.",closed_qa
Does tumour necrosis factor-alpha affect blood-brain barrier permeability and tight junction-associated occludin in acute liver failure?,"Cerebral oedema leading to cerebral herniation is a major cause of death during acute liver failure (ALF), but the underlying mechanism is not clear. We investigated the role of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in changing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during ALF. ALF animal models were generated by administering D-galactosamine (GalN) and lipopolysaccharide, or GalN and TNF-alpha. ALF induction was blocked by first administering anti-TNF-alpha-IgG or anti-TNF-alpha-R1. We investigated the BBB permeability with Evans blue staining, and the structure with electron microscopy. BBB permeability increased in ALF mice and correlated with elevated serum TNF-alpha levels. No vascular endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis was detected, but electron microscopy of cells from human and mouse ALF tissues revealed tight junction (TJ) disruptions and EC shrinkage, as well as increased vesicles and vacuoles. In addition, the expression of the TJ-associated protein occludin was significantly decreased in both ALF mice and patients, although the expression of occludin mRNA did not change. Changes in BBB permeability, brain tissue ultrastructure and occludin expression in ALF-induced mice could be prevented by prophylaxis treatment with either antibody to TNF-alpha-IgG or antibody to TNF-alpha-R1.","Our results suggest that TNF-alpha plays a critical role in the development of brain oedema in ALF, and that both vasogenic and cytotoxic mechanisms may be involved. Increased BBB permeability may be because of the disruption of TJs, and loss of the TJ-associated protein occludin.",closed_qa
Is measurement of myocardial fractional flow reserve a cost-effective way to identify coronary artery lesions of indeterminate severity that warrant revascularisation?,"The RADI pressure wire may be used in stenotic coronary arteries to calculate myocardial fractional flow reserve (FFR(myo)), the ratio between distal hyperaemic coronary pressure and aortic pressure. A ratio less than 0.75 categorizes lesions of haemodynamic significance for which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be warranted. We undertook this study to evaluate the cost implications of performing these measurements. We recorded FFR(myo) using RADI wires in 32 coronary artery lesions of between 30 and 60% diameter stenosis in 31 patients and assessed how this information changed our management. We followed our original ""management plan"" in only eight patients. PCI or CABG was performed in eight whose lesions were characterised by a FFR(myo) value of 0.76 or less. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) was done in only one of nine for whom this had seemed to be appropriate. Two-thirds of those for whom PCI had appeared to be warranted were treated conservatively and only one quarter of the original ""surgical"" group underwent CABG.","Although RADI pressure wires are an additional expense, it is appropriate to use them to assess coronary stenotic lesions of indeterminate severity. When we took into account the savings that arose from changes in management, the additional cost of measuring FFR(myo) was around dollar 580 per study.",closed_qa
Do urinary TIMP-1 and MMP-2 levels detect the presence of pancreatic malignancies?,"A majority of patients with pancreatic malignancies, including both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs), present with advanced disease due to a lack of specific symptoms and current diagnostic limitations, making this disease extremely difficult to detect. Our goal was to determine whether urinary matrix metalloproteases (uMMPs) and/or their endogenous inhibitors, urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (uTIMPs), could be detected in the urine of patients with pancreatic malignancies and whether they may serve as independent predictors of disease status. Retrospective analyses of urine samples (n=139) from PDAC and pNET patients as well as age- and sex-matched controls were conducted. Urinary MMP-2 and uTIMP-1 levels were determined using ELISA and zymography. Biomarker expression in tumour and normal pancreatic tissues was analysed via immunohistochemistry (IHC). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that, when controlling for age and sex, uMMP-2 (P<0.0001) and uTIMP-1 (P<0.0001) but not uMMP-9, were significant independent predictors for distinguishing between PDAC patients and healthy controls. Our data also indicated that uMMP-2 was an independent predictor of the presence of pNET. In addition, uTIMP-1 levels could differentiate the two cancer groups, PDAC and pNET, respectively. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that MMP-2 and TIMP-1 protein expression is significantly upregulated in PDAC tissue compared with the normal pancreas.","Taken together, our results suggest that the detection of uMMP-2 and uTIMP-1 may have diagnostic value in the detection of pancreatic malignancies and that uTIMP-1 may be useful in distinguishing between pancreatic adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumours.",closed_qa
Is microvascular glycocalyx dimension estimated by automated SDF imaging related to cardiovascular disease?,"The EG regulates vascular homeostasis and has anti-atherogenic properties. SDF imaging allows for noninvasive visualization of microvessels and automated estimation of EG dimensions. We aimed to assess whether microcirculatory EG dimension is related to cardiovascular disease. Sublingual EG dimension was estimated by SDF imaging in healthy volunteers and in patients visiting an outpatient clinic for vascular medicine of a university hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. EG dimension was compared among healthy volunteers, patients with CVD, and patients at low (<10%) or high risk (≥ 10%) of CVD according to the Framingham algorithm. In total 120 patients and 30 healthy volunteers were included. Patients had a mean age of 59 ± 14 years, 71 (59%) were men and 24 (20%) were black. Healthy volunteers were on average 28 ± 4 years and 19 (63%) were men. EG dimension was similar in healthy volunteers (2.04 ± 0.23 μm), low-risk patients (2.05 ± 0.24 μm, n = 39), high-risk patients (2.05 ± 0.23 μm, n = 30) and in patients with CVD (2.09 ± 0.21 μm, n = 51, p = 0.79). EG dimension was not correlated with cardiovascular risk factors.","Microcirculatory EG dimension, as estimated by automated SDF imaging, is not associated with CVD, suggesting that this technique may not contribute to cardiovascular risk stratification.",closed_qa
Does breakfast glycemic index affect subsequent daily energy intake in free-living healthy children?,"Experimental studies have reported that the effect of a meal's glycemic index (GI) on subsequent energy intake depends on the timing of the subsequent meal. We examined whether the timing of the next meal after breakfast modifies the effect of the breakfast GI (GI(br)) on subsequent daytime energy intake of healthy free-living children. Analyses included 381 participants of the DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometrical Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) Study who had provided weighed dietary records at ages 2, 4-5, and 7 y. At all ages, among children who consumed their next meal in the early postprandial phase (after 3-4 h), children with a lower GI(br) consumed more calories throughout the remainder of the day than did children with a higher GI(br), independent of major dietary confounders. For the age groups 2, 4-5, and 7 y, energy intakes in tertiles 1 and 3 were 785 kcal (95% CI: 743-830 kcal) and 717 kcal (678-758 kcal), P for trend = 0.2; 993 kcal (941-1047 kcal) and 949 kcal (900-1000 kcal), P for trend = 0.05; 1255 (1171-1344) and 1166 (1090-1247 kcal), P for trend = 0.03, respectively. Conversely, among children consuming their next meal in the late postprandial phase (>3-4 h), subsequent daytime energy intake was not associated with GI(br).","This study confirms differential early and late postprandial effects of the GI(br) on subsequent daytime energy intake for free-living children at different ages. Interestingly, the apparent short-term satiating effect of a higher GI(br), in particular, persisted throughout the day, if a second breakfast was consumed midmorning.",closed_qa
Do vascular endothelial growth factor plasma levels correlate to the clinical picture in severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome?,"To assess the potential involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor in the hyperpermeability characterizing the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). A controlled clinical study that followed the kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor in the plasma of patients with severe OHSS from the time of admission to the hospital and until clinical resolution. Women hospitalized with severe OHSS in a tertiary medical center. Seven patients with severe OHSS after ovulation induction for IVF and seven controls who had received a similar ovulation induction regimen and did not develop the OHSS. Three blood samples were obtained from each OHSS patient: upon hospitalization for severe OHSS, when significant clinical improvement was evident, and on the first follow-up visit after the patients' discharge. Ascitic fluid was obtained from all OHSS patients by therapeutic paracentesis during the active phase of the syndrome. Blood samples were drawn from the control patients 4 to 6 days after ET. All samples were assayed for vascular endothelial growth factor levels, hematocrit, E2 levels, and white blood cell count. Vascular endothelial growth factor levels were assayed by ELISA. Estradiol was determined by RIA. Compared with the controls, high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor were detected in the plasma of all patients admitted for severe OHSS. Levels dropped significantly along with clinical improvement, reaching minimum values after complete resolution. A statistically significant correlation was found between plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels and certain biologic characteristics of OHSS and of capillary leakage such as leukocytosis and increased hematocrit. Ascitic fluid obtained from the study patients also contained high vascular endothelial growth factor levels.",These findings suggest the involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor in the pathogenesis of capillary leakage in the OHSS.,closed_qa
Does glove Contamination during Endodontic Treatment be One of the Sources of Nosocomial Endodontic Propionibacterium acnes Infections?,"The opportunistic Propionibacterium acnes recovered frequently from failed endodontic treatments might be the result of nosocomial endodontic infections. The study was aimed to determine if gloves worn by dentists could be one of the sources of these nosocomial infections and to investigate the P. acnes phylotypes involved. The cultivable microbiota of gloves (n = 8) at 4 time points (T1, immediately after wearing gloves; T2, after access cavity preparation; T3, after taking a working length/master cone radiograph; and T4, before sealing the cavity) were identified using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. recA gene sequencing of P. acnes isolates was done. The phylogenetic relationship was determined using MEGA 6 (http://www.megasoftware.net/fixedbugs.html; Megasoftware, Tempe, AZ). Data distributions were compared using the Fisher exact test; means were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test in SPSSPC (version 21; IBM, Armonk, NY). The quantitative viable counts at T4 (aerobically [2.93 ± 0.57], anaerobically [3.35 ± 0.43]) were greater (P < .001) than at T1 [(aerobically [0.48 ± 0.73], anaerobically [0.66 ± 0.86]) and T2 (aerobically [1.80 ± 0.54], anaerobically [2.41 ± 0.71]). Eighty cultivable bacterial taxa (5 phyla) were identified. The most prevalent ones were P. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis (100%). recA gene sequencing (n = 88) revealed 2 phylogenetic lineages with type I split into type IA and type IB. Type II was prevalent on gloves.","Contamination of the gloves was detected at the final stages of the treatment. P. acnes and S. epidermidis are the prevalent taxa on gloves and are opportunistic endodontic pathogens. Changing gloves frequently, after gaining access into the pulp space and also after taking the working length/master gutta-percha point radiographs, is likely to reduce the risk of root canal reinfection.",closed_qa
"Is the therapeutic response in Gorham 's syndrome to the beta-blocking agent propranolol correlated to VEGF-A , but not to VEGF-C or FLT1 expression?","Gorham's syndrome is a rare illness of unknown etiology. It is characterized by a local proliferation of blood or lymphatic vessels that in bones leads to progressive resorption and destruction. The cause of the disease is not elucidated, and therapeutic options remain limited. We report herein the case of a young female Caucasian patient aged 18 years with diffuse Gorham syndrome. In tissue specimens angiogenesis and massive lymphangiogenesis as well as the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and neuropilins was observed. Lymphangiogenesis is a prominent feature of the disease and a number of lymphatic markers were found to be expressed, however only VEGF-A, but not vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) was found to be elevated in the circulation. Circulating levels of soluble VEGF receptor-1 were also not elevated. Furthermore, the patient responded favorably and the disease was stabilized following treatment with the beta-blocking agent Propranolol alone which acts on VEGF-A alone, but not on soluble VEGF receptor-1 levels.","This suggests that the disease is dependent on VEGF-A, but on neither VEGF-C, the major driver of lymphangiogenesis, nor FLT1. Furthermore, Propranolol acts on VEGF-A but not FLT1 expression.",closed_qa
Does education level influence the decision to undergo elective repeat caesarean section among women with a previous caesarean section?,"Patient education level has been shown to affect health care outcomes in a variety of clinical contexts. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether maternal education level influences women to plan elective repeat Caesarean section rather than attempt a vaginal birth after Caesarean. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women with a previous Caesarean section who delivered at the Royal Victoria Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Education level was stratified as follows:</= 11 years (up to and including a high school diploma), 12 to 15 years (some college or university education), and>/= 16 years (university degree). We used unconditional logistic regression to calculate age-adjusted estimates of the risk of having a planned Caesarean section. Among 18 673 deliveries in our cohort, 1915 were in women with a previous Caesarean section. Of these, 12.6% had a high school degree or less, 38.3% had some college or university education, and 49.1% had a university degree. Compared with women whose maximum education was a high school diploma, there was a higher rate of planned Caesarean section in women with some college or university education (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.89, P = 0.047) and in women with a university degree (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.94, P = 0.03).","Higher education appears to be associated with an increased rate of elective repeat Caesarean section. Whether this is due to patient differences or physician bias, physicians should be aware of this disparity and should attempt to provide unbiased informed consent for all women regardless of their level of education.",closed_qa
Should the pericardium be closed routinely after heart operations?,"Repeat coronary artery bypass grafting is more difficult if the right ventricle is firmly attached to the inner table of the sternum. Closure of the pericardium at the time of the initial procedure may prevent attachment of the right ventricle to the sternum. This study attempts to identify the geometric effects of pericardial closure early after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. Forty-two patients undergoing elective, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized into two groups: 20 patients underwent closure of the pericardium (Closure group) and the pericardium was left open in 22 patients (Open group). Radiopaque markers were attached to the anterior aspect of the right ventricular epicardium in both groups. Postoperative chest roentgenograms revealed that the distance between the epicardial surface and the posterior table of the sternum was larger in the Closure group compared to the Open group at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively (p<0.001). Cardiac index and stroke work index in the early postoperative period was lower in the Closure group compared to the Open group (p<0.001) despite similar filling pressures.","Pericardial closure may reduce the risk of myocardial injury during sternotomy for repeat coronary artery bypass grafting by preventing right ventricular adhesions.

Do multiple intravenous doses of paracetamol result in a predictable pharmacokinetic profile in very preterm infants?,"The therapeutic options available to treat neonatal pain are limited, and one alternative for nonopioid systemic treatment is paracetamol. However, pharmacokinetic data from prolonged administration of intravenous paracetamol in neonates are limited. The aim of this study was to present pharmacokinetics after multiple dose of intravenous paracetamol in very preterm infants of <32 weeks' gestation. Fifteen very preterm infants received five, six-hourly doses of intravenous paracetamol (7.5 mg/kg). Blood samples were taken to measure paracetamol, glutathione and hepatic function, together with urine samples for paracetamol metabolites. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model gave the best fit for all individual patients and resulted in a predictable pharmacokinetic profile. The estimated pharmacokinetic population parameters were volume of distribution 0.764 ± 0.225 L/kg, elimination rate constant (ke ) 0.117 ± 0.091/h and intercompartment rate constants k12 0.607 ± 0.734/h and k21 1.105 ± 0.762/h.",Our study found that multiple doses of intravenous paracetamol resulted in a predictable pharmacokinetic profile in very preterm infants.

Is thioredoxin interacting protein ( TXNIP ) a novel tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer?,"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and many patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) fail to respond to conventional therapies, resulting in morbidity and mortality. Additional therapeutic targets and treatment options are needed for these patients. We recently reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is highly expressed in ATC and confers an aggressive phenotype when overexpressed in DTC cells. Microarray analysis was used to identify downstream targets of PPARγ in ATC cells. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) expression in thyroid cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens. Retroviral transduction was used to generate ATC cell lines that overexpress TXNIP, and assays that assess glucose uptake, viable cell proliferation, and invasion were used to characterize the in vitro properties of these cells. An orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse model was used to assess the effect of TXNIP overexpression in ATC cell lines in vivo. Using microarray analysis, we show that TXNIP is highly upregulated when PPARγ is depleted from ATC cells. Using Western blot analysis and IHC, we show that DTC and ATC cells exhibit differential TXNIP expression patterns. DTC cell lines and patient tumors have high TXNIP expression in contrast to low or absent expression in ATC cell lines and tumors. Overexpression of TXNIP decreases the growth of HTh74 cells compared to vector controls and inhibits glucose uptake in the ATC cell lines HTh74 and T238. Importantly, TXNIP overexpression in T238 cells results in attenuated tumor growth and decreased metastasis in an orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse model.","Our findings indicate that TXNIP functions as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cells, and its downregulation is likely important in the transition from differentiated to advanced thyroid cancer. These studies underscore the potential of TXNIP as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic indicator in advanced thyroid cancer.",closed_qa
Is protein kinase C-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in enterocytes independent of IkappaB degradation?,"Nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is a proximal step in the signal transduction of a pleiotropic group of proinflammatory genes. Activation of RelA is under the negative control of IkappaB, a family of proteins degraded in response to immunologic and oxidant stimuli. The aim of this study was to examine this mechanism of NF-kappaB activation in intestinal epithelial cells. DLD-1 cell monolayers stimulated by interleukin (IL)-1beta or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were assayed for the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and immunoreactivity of various IkappaB isoforms that regulate NF-kappaB1/RelA activation. NF-kappaB activation triggered by PMA was not associated with the disappearance of immunoreactive IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, IkappaBgamma, or IkappaBepsilon or with the dissociation of intact IkappaB from RelA. NF-kappaB activation induced by PMA was blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine but not by the proteasomal inhibitor N-acetyl-leucine leucine norleucinal (ALLN). In contrast, IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activation was associated with the disappearance of IkappaBalpha and was inhibited by ALLN but not staurosporine.",Our data imply the existence of a novel pathway of NF-kappaB activation mediated by protein kinase C that does not require proteosomal degradation or the loss of IkappaB.,closed_qa
Expression of synovial fluid and articular cartilage VIP in human osteoarthritic knee: a new indicator of disease severity?,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a molecule shared by the neuroendocrine immune network and is considered to be a potential candidate for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Although some recent studies demonstrate that VIP has a protective role in animal RA models, its variant in different disease grade of OA remains uncertain. Fifty patients with primary knee OA and ten controls with severe trauma were enrolled. Synovial fluid and articular cartilage samples were collected from specimens of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or knee above amputation. VIP levels in these samples were assessed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Kellgren-Lawrence criteria and Mankin score were taken to determine the disease severity. Compared to the controls, OA patients have lower VIP concentration in synovial fluid (659.70±112.79, 95%CI 579.01-740.38 vs 470.83±156.40, 95%CI 426.38-515.28 pg/mL, P<0.001) and articular cartilage (0.26±0.02, 95%CI 0.24-0.28 vs 0.20±0.04, 95%CI 0.18-0.21, P<0.001). Subsequent analysis show that the VIP expression in synovial fluid is markedly correlated with its OD in articular cartilage (Pearson's r=0.580, P<0.001). Furthermore, the synovial fluid and articular cartilage levels of VIP both demonstrated to be negatively correlated with severity of disease (Spearman's ρ=0.838, P<0.001; Spearman's ρ=0.814, P<0.001).",VIP in synovial fluid and articular cartilage is negatively associated with progressive joint damage in OA and is a potential indictor of disease severity.,closed_qa
Is sRC dephosphorylated at tyrosine 530 in human colon carcinomas?,"Src is a protein tyrosine kinase that plays important roles in cancer development, and Src kinase activity has been found to be elevated in several types of cancers. However, the cause of the elevation of Src kinase activity in the majority of human colon carcinomas is still largely unknown. We aim at finding the cause of elevated Src kinase activity in human colon carcinomas. We employed normal colon epithelial FHC cells and examined Src activation in human colon carcinoma specimens from 8 patients. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blotting, and the activity of Src kinase by kinase assay. Actin levels were different between tumor and normal tissues, demonstrating the complexities and inhomogeneities of the tissue samples. Src kinase activities were increased in the majority of the colon carcinomas as compared with normal colon epithelial cells (range 13-29). Src protein levels were reduced in the colon carcinomas. Src Y530 phosphorylation levels were reduced to a higher extent than protein levels in the carcinomas.","The results suggest that Src specific activities were highly increased in human colon carcinomas; phosphorylation at Src Y530 was reduced, contributing to the highly elevated Src specific activity and Src kinase activity.",closed_qa
Is temporary placement of a paclitaxel or rapamycin-eluting stent effective to reduce stenting induced inflammatory reaction and scaring in benign cardia stricture models?,"To investigate whether temporary placement of a paclitaxel or rapamycin eluting stent is more effective to reduce stenting induced inflammatory reaction and scaring than a bared stent in benign cardia stricture models. Eighty dog models of stricture were randomly divided into a control group (CG, n=20, no stent insertion), a bare stent group (BSG, n=20), a paclitaxel eluting (Pacl-ESG, n=20) and a rapamycin eluting stent group (Rapa-ESG, n=20), with one-week stent retention. Lower-oesophageal-sphincter pressure (LOSP), 5-minute barium height (5-mBH) and cardia diameter were assessed before, immediately after the procedure, and regularly for 6 months. Five dogs in each group were euthanized for histological examination at each follow-up assessment. Stent insertion was well tolerated, with similar migration rates in three groups. At 6 months, LOSP and 5-mBH improved in Pacl-ESG and Rapa-ESG compared to BSG (p<0.05), with no difference between Pacl-ESG and Rapa-ESG (p>0.05). Cardia kept more patency in the Pacl-ESG and Rapa-ESG than in BSG (p<0.05). Reduced peak inflammatory reactions and scarring occurred in the Pacl-ESG and Rapa-ESG compared to BSG (p<0.05), with a similar outcome in the Pacl-ESG and Rapa-ESG (p>0.05).",Paclitaxel or rapamycin-eluting stents insertion led to better outcomes than bare stents in benign cardia stricture models.,closed_qa
Does a cytotoxic phenotype predict clinical outcome in anaplastic large cell lymphomas?,"To investigate whether anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) expressing cytotoxic proteins have a relatively worse clinical outcome compared with ALCL lacking a cytotoxic phenotype. 59 primary cases of ALCL originating from different sites were investigated by immunohistochemistry for the presence of the cytotoxic proteins T cell intracytoplasmic antigen (TIA-1) and granzyme B in the neoplastic cells. Since site of origin and expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) strongly influence prognosis, the presence of a cytotoxic phenotype was also investigated in relation to the primary site of origin (lymph node, gut, or skin) and ALK expression. The prognostic value was investigated by analysis of overall and relapse-free survival time, including Cox regression analysis. 39 of 59 ALCL (66%) appeared to have a cytotoxic phenotype as shown by expression of TIA-1 or granzyme B or both in the neoplastic cells. The presence of a cytotoxic phenotype did not have any influence on prognosis. Even when the survival data were corrected for site of origin and stage at presentation or were analysed separately for ALK positive and negative cases, no prognostic influence of a cytotoxic phenotype was observed.","In primary biopsies of patients with ALCL, the presence of a cytotoxic phenotype is not related to clinical outcome of the disease.",closed_qa
Does dialysis filter type determine the acute effect of haemodialysis on endothelial function and oxidative stress?,"Endothelial function of large arteries is impaired in chronic haemodialysis patients and oxidative stress due to the dialysis procedure has been suggested as a causal factor. However, it is not clear whether different types of dialysis membranes affect endothelial function differently. Therefore we determined endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery as well as markers of oxidative stress immediately before and after haemodialysis (HD) with either a cellulosic cuprophane or a synthetic polysulphone dialyser in a blinded, randomized, cross-over study. Twelve haemodialysis patients (age 55+/-3 years, time on dialysis 20+/-2 months, mean fluid change -1782+/-21 ml, systolic/diastolic blood pressure 139/75 mmHg) were included. Using a multi-gate-pulsed Doppler system (echo-tracking device) brachial artery FMD and nitroglycerine-induced, endothelium-independent vasodilatation (NMD) were measured. Patients were randomized to HD with either a polysulphone or a cuprophane membrane and were crossed over to the other filter. Investigators were blinded to the type of membrane used. Serum concentrations of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and alpha-tocopherol as markers of oxidative stress were measured before and after each dialysis session. Data are given as mean+/-SEM. Treatment with polysulphone filter HD did not significantly affect FMD (baseline 9.3+/-2.0% vs after HD 9.6+/-1.8%). After dialysis with a cuprophane membrane FMD decreased from 9.4+/-2.1 to 7.4+/-1.8% (P<0.05). NMD was not significantly affected by HD irrespective of the membrane material used. Serum levels of oxLDL were not changed by either treatment; however, alpha-tocopherol concentrations fell significantly after dialysis with the cuprophane filter (baseline 18.0+/-2.3 after HD 16.6+/-1.3 micro g/ml, P<0.05), while alpha-tocopherol levels remained unchanged when the polysulphone membrane was used.","The type of dialysis filter membrane determines the acute effect of haemodialysis on arterial endothelial function. Differences in biocompatibility and oxidative stress may account for the observed differential effects, since the decrease of FMD after dialysis with a cellulosic cuprophane membrane-but not with a synthetic polysulphone membrane-was associated with a reduction in serum vitamin E.",closed_qa
Does cariporide potentiate the effects of epinephrine and vasopressin by nonvascular mechanisms during closed-chest resuscitation?,"The efficacy of vasopressor therapy during closed-chest resuscitation is limited and decreases over time. We previously reported that sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 inhibition during ventricular fibrillation (VF) using cariporide ameliorates ischemic contracture and enhances the efficacy of chest compression. We currently investigated whether cariporide could potentiate pressor responses to epinephrine and vasopressin. VF was induced and left untreated for 12 min in two series of 16 rats each. Chest compression was then started and the depth adjusted within the initial 2 min to attain an aortic diastolic pressure between 26 and 28 mm Hg. In one series, rats received boluses of epinephrine (150 microg/kg); in the other series, rats received boluses of vasopressin (0.8 U/kg) to maintain the aortic diastolic pressure > 25 mm Hg. Within each series, rats were randomized to receive a 3 mg/kg bolus of cariporide or 0.9% NaCl immediately before starting chest compression. Defibrillation was attempted at 20 min of VF (8 min of chest compression). Cariporide prompted higher and more sustained coronary perfusion pressures in both the epinephrine group (37 +/- 5 mm Hg vs 29 +/- 7 mm Hg, p < 0.05) and the vasopressin group (36 +/- 5 mm Hg vs 28 +/- 6 mm Hg +/- SD, p < 0.02) even though fewer additional vasopressor doses were required. After resuscitation, cariporide-treated rats had less ventricular ectopic activity, better hemodynamic function, and improved survival scores. In separate experiments, in situ perfusion of the aorta excluded a vascular-mediated effect of cariporide.",Cariporide enhanced the hemodynamic efficacy of vasopressor agents and improved resuscitation outcomes probably as a result of enhanced forward blood flow without effect on the peripheral vasculature.,closed_qa
Does high-throughput DNA methylation analysis in anorexia nervosa confirm TNXB hypermethylation?,"Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) are ideally suited to identify differentially methylated genes in response to starvation. We examined high-throughput DNA methylation derived from whole blood of 47 females with AN, 47 lean females without AN and 100 population-based females to compare AN with both controls. To account for different cell type compositions, we applied two reference-free methods (FastLMM-EWASher, RefFreeEWAS) and searched for consensus CpG sites identified by both methods. We used a validation sample of five monozygotic AN-discordant twin pairs. Fifty-one consensus sites were identified in AN vs. lean and 81 in AN vs. population-based comparisons. These sites have not been reported in AN methylation analyses, but for the latter comparison 54/81 sites showed directionally consistent differential methylation effects in the AN-discordant twins. For a single nucleotide polymorphism rs923768 in CSGALNACT1 a nearby site was nominally associated with AN. At the gene level, we confirmed hypermethylated sites at TNXB. We found support for a locus at NR1H3 in the AN vs. lean control comparison, but the methylation direction was opposite to the one previously reported.","We confirm genes like TNXB previously described to comprise differentially methylated sites, and highlight further sites that might be specifically involved in AN starvation processes.",closed_qa
Does sexual conflict predict morphology and behavior in two species of penduline tits?,"The evolutionary interests of males and females rarely coincide (sexual conflict), and these conflicting interests influence morphology, behavior and speciation in various organisms. We examined consequences of variation in sexual conflict in two closely-related passerine birds with contrasting breeding systems: the Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus (EPT) exhibiting a highly polygamous breeding system with sexually antagonistic interests over parental care, and the socially monogamous Cape penduline tit Anthoscopus minutus (CPT). We derived four a priori predictions from sexual conflict theory and tested these using data collected in Central Europe (EPT) and South Africa (CPT). Firstly, we predicted that EPTs exhibit more sexually dimorphic plumage than CPTs due to more intense sexual selection. Secondly, we expected brighter EPT males to provide less care than duller males. Thirdly, since song is a sexually selected trait in many birds, male EPTs were expected to exhibit more complex songs than CPT males. Finally, intense sexual conflict in EPT was expected to lead to low nest attendance as an indication of sexually antagonistic interests, whereas we expected more cooperation between parents in CPT consistent with their socially monogamous breeding system. Consistent with our predictions EPTs exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in plumage and more complex song than CPTs, and brighter EPT males provided less care than duller ones. EPT parents attended the nest less frequently and less simultaneously than CPT parents.","These results are consistent with sexual conflict theory: species in which sexual conflict is more manifested (EPT) exhibited a stronger sexual dimorphism and more elaborated sexually selected traits than species with less intense sexual conflict (CPT). Our results are also consistent with the notion that EPTs attempt to force their partner to work harder as expected under sexual conflict: each member of the breeding pair attempts to shift the costs of care to the other parent. More brightly colored males benefit more from desertion than dull ones, because they are more likely to remate with a new female. Taken together, the comparison between two closely related species with contrasting breeding systems suggest that sexual conflict over care has influenced the evolution of behavior and morphology in penduline tits.",closed_qa
Are postural response latencies related to balance control during standing and walking in patients with multiple sclerosis?,"To understand and examine the relation between postural response latencies obtained during postural perturbations and representative measures of balance during standing (sway variables) and walking (trunk motion). Cross-sectional. University medical center. Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (n=20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of <5 seconds. None. Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables. We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: ρ=.334, P=.04; range: ρ=.385, P=.017; mean velocity: ρ=.337, P=.038; total sway area: ρ=.393, P=.015). Postural response latency was also significantly correlated with motion of the trunk during walking (sagittal plane range of motion: ρ=.316, P=.05; SD of transverse plane range of motion: ρ=-.43, P=.006).",These findings clearly indicate that slow postural responses to external perturbations in patients with MS contribute to disturbances in balance control during both standing and walking.,closed_qa

Does insight have specific correlation with symptom dimensions in OCD?,"To study relationship between insight and clinical characteristics in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Sample included 545 consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV OCD who consulted a specialty OCD Clinic at a tertiary psychiatric hospital in India between January 2004 and December 2009. They had been evaluated with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) symptom checklist, severity rating scale and the item 11 for insight, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI). Regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of insight. The sample had 498 (91%) subjects with good insight (score≤2) and 47 (9%) subjects with poor insight (score>2) as per the Y-BOCS item11. Poor insight group had a significantly higher score on the Y-BOCS compulsions (p<0.001) and total score (p=0.001), the CGI-Severity (p=0.001) and a higher rate of contamination fears (p<0.001) and washing compulsions (p<0.001). Good insight group had a significantly higher frequency of aggressive obsessions (p<0.001). In linear regression, contamination dimension (p=0.007) and Y-BOCS total score (p<0.001) predicted poorer insight and presence of forbidden thoughts (p=0.006) predicted better insight. Study sample is from a specialty OCD clinic of a major psychiatric hospital in India and therefore, generalizability to other clinical settings may be limited.","Poor insight is associated with severe form of OCD, and is associated with contamination dimension. That degree of insight has specific correlation with certain symptom dimensions adds to the growing knowledge on the dimensional aspect of OCD. Insight has to be systematically assessed in all OCD subjects particularly in those with contamination fears. Failure to systematically assess insight may have treatment implications.",closed_qa
Does systemic endothelial dysfunction in children with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension correlate with disease severity?,"Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a life-threatening disease manifested by progressive pulmonary vascular remodeling, compromised pulmonary blood flow and right heart failure. Most studies have explored how pulmonary endothelial function modulates disease pathogenesis. We hypothesize that IPAH is a progressive panvasculopathy, affecting both pulmonary and systemic vascular beds, and that systemic endothelial dysfunction correlates with disease severity. Recent studies have demonstrated systemic endothelial dysfunction in adults with pulmonary hypertension; however, adults often have additional comorbidities affecting endothelial function. Systemic endothelial function has not been explored in children with IPAH. In this single-center, prospective, cross-sectional study we examined brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a nitric oxide-mediated, endothelial-dependent response, in children with IPAH and matched controls. FMD measurements were compared with clinical and echocardiographic measures of IPAH severity. Thirteen patients and 13 controls were studied, ranging in age from 6 to 20 years. FMD was decreased in IPAH subjects compared with controls (5.1 ± 2.1% vs 9.7 ± 2.0%; p < 0.0001). In IPAH subjects, FMD correlated directly with cardiac index (R(2) = 0.34, p = 0.035), and inversely with tricuspid regurgitation velocity (R(2) = 0.57, p = 0.019) and right ventricular myocardial performance index (R(2) = 0.44, p = 0.028).","The presence of systemic endothelial dysfunction in children with IPAH and its strong association with IPAH severity demonstrate that IPAH is a global vasculopathy. Although morbidity in IPAH is typically associated with pulmonary vascular disease, systemic vascular changes may also relate to disease pathogenesis and progression. Further study into shared mechanisms of systemic and pulmonary endothelial dysfunction may contribute to future therapies for IPAH.",closed_qa
Serum free ropivacaine concentrations among patients receiving continuous peripheral nerve block catheters: is it safe for long-term infusions?,"Ropivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic used for continuous peripheral nerve catheter infusions. Catheters may remain in situ for prolonged time periods. In the present study, patients were enrolled to receive continuous peripheral nerve catheters with measurement of free serum ropivacaine concentrations. Peripheral nerve catheters were placed for postoperative pain management in trauma patients and infused with ropivacaine 0.2% or bolused with 0.5%. Blood samples were obtained from each subject on days 0 (preinfusion), 3, 5, 7, 10, and every third day until catheter removal. Serum free ropivacaine concentrations were measured via high-performance liquid chromatography and were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. One hundred thirty-three blood samples were analyzed in 35 patients; all serum free ropivacaine concentrations after infusion initiation (99 samples from 35 subjects) were below 0.34 mg/L (previously determined toxic threshold). The highest concentration achieved in a blood sample was 0.19 mg/L; all other values were<0.09 mg/L. The total amount of drug received during the study ranged from 1146 to 22,320 mg (median of 3722 mg). Catheters remained in situ for a median of 7 days (range: 3-23). From day 0 to 3 (preinfusion), 77% of the study participants had an increase in the serum free-fraction ropivacaine concentrations. The median concentration on day 3 was 0.025 mg/L (95% upper confidence limit for mean: 0.05, range:<0.01-0.19); P<0.001 compared with preinfusion levels). From day 3 to 5, 68% of the participants had a decrease in the serum free ropivacaine concentrations (median level 0.016 mg/L [95% upper confidence limit for mean: 0.021]P = 0.007 for day 5 compared with day 3).","In this study, free serum ropivacaine concentrations remained well below toxic values despite large amounts of drug administration in combat-wounded patients.

Is piggyBac an effective tool for functional analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum genome?,"Much of the Plasmodium falciparum genome encodes hypothetical proteins with limited homology to other organisms. A lack of robust tools for genetic manipulation of the parasite limits functional analysis of these hypothetical proteins and other aspects of the Plasmodium genome. Transposon mutagenesis has been used widely to identify gene functions in many organisms and would be extremely valuable for functional analysis of the Plasmodium genome. In this study, we investigated the lepidopteran transposon, piggyBac, as a molecular genetic tool for functional characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum genome. Through multiple transfections, we generated 177 unique P. falciparum mutant clones with mostly single piggyBac insertions in their genomes. Analysis of piggyBac insertion sites revealed random insertions into the P. falciparum genome, in regards to gene expression in parasite life cycle stages and functional categories. We further explored the possibility of forward genetic studies in P. falciparum with a phenotypic screen for attenuated growth, which identified several parasite genes and pathways critical for intra-erythrocytic development.","Our results clearly demonstrate that piggyBac is a novel, indispensable tool for forward functional genomics in P. falciparum that will help better understand parasite biology and accelerate drug and vaccine development.",closed_qa
Expression of CD44 in uterine cervical squamous neoplasia: a predictor of microinvasion?,"CD44, an integral membrane glycoprotein, may have an important role in early tumorigenesis, specifically, facilitating early tumor progression. Reports of the expression of CD44 in early uterine cervical squamous carcinogenesis are conflicting. We examined the expression of CD44 in microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix (MIC), as yet unreported, and compared it to that in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and CIN 3 to further elucidate its role in early squamous carcinogenesis. Seventeen cases of CIN 1, 24 cases of CIN 3, and 20 cases of MIC were stained with antibodies to CD44s, CD44v5, and CD44v6. Only membranous staining was considered positive. Positive membranous staining (>50% cells) was observed in 97% of cases of CIN 1 using all three antibodies. In CIN 3, positive staining was seen more often with CD44v6 (18/24) and CD44v5 (19/24) than with CD44s (6/24). Expression of CD44v6 was retained more often in MIC (16/20) compared with CD44s (3/20) and CD44v5 (9/20). Those cases of CIN 3 and MIC that failed to meet our criteria for positive staining showed either heterogeneous or absent staining.",There is a qualitative and quantitative reduction in expression of CD44 in MIC and CIN 3 compared with CIN 1. Down-regulation of CD44 variants may occur later in neoplastic progression than CD44s. This pattern may reflect their important biological function in early progression by cervical cancer cells. Patchy and heterogeneous staining in more advanced lesions limits the usefulness of CD44 and its variants in the assessment of microinvasion.,closed_qa
Are chronic peritoneal dialysis in children with special needs or social disadvantage or both : contraindications always contraindications?,"Our aim in the present study was to identify outcomes in children with special needs or social disadvantage, or both, receiving chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) treatment in a pediatric dialysis unit. Among 110 children started on CPD in our unit during the period between November 1995 and November 2008, we identified 13 patients (8 girls, 5 boys) with major physical, mental, or psychosocial problems. Age at CPD initiation in the group with disability ranged from 4.0 years to 16.5 years (median: 7.5 years). Under lying diseases were vesicoureteral reflux (4 patients), neuropathic bladder and vesicoureteral reflux (3 patients), chronic pyelonephritis (3 patients), amyloidosis (2 patients), and Alport syndrome (1 patient). Challenges encountered were adverse family or social circumstances (4 patients), cerebral palsy (3 patients), Down syndrome (1 patient), rectovesical fistula in conjunction with ectopic anus and previous multiple abdominal surgery (1 patient), blindness and deafness (1 patient), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (1 patient), colostomy and malnutrition (1 patient), and mental retardation and blindness (1 patient). All catheters were implanted percutaneously. Median duration of dialysis was 18 months (range: 6 - 124 months). The frequency of peritonitis was not different between children with and without disability (p > 0.05). In children with disability compared with children without disability, the frequencies of catheter-related infections (1 episode/79.3 patient-months vs 1 episode/32.4 patient-months) and of catheter-related non-infectious complications (1 episode/238 patient-months vs 1 episode/115.7 patient-months) were lower (p < 0.05). Chronic peritoneal dialysis was terminated in 5 children (for renal transplantation in 3, switch to hemodialysis in 1, death in 1).","Our results suggest that, with appropriate family support and an experienced multidisciplinary team, CPD can be effectively performed in children with special needs or social disadvantage, or both.",closed_qa
Do enamel factors regulate expression of genes associated with cementoblasts?,"In order to design predictable periodontal regenerative therapies, it is important to understand the responsiveness of cells within the local environment to factors considered attractive candidates. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an enamel matrix derivative (EMD) on cementoblast behavior in vitro and in vivo. Osteocalcin (OC) promoter SV40 transgenic mice were used to obtain cementoblasts. For comparison, preosteoblasts from these mice, as well as another murine pre-osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1 cells, were used. Cells exposed to EMD were evaluated for changes in: 1) proliferation over an 8-day period by cell counting; 2) gene expression using Northern blot analysis; and 3) biomineralization by von Kossa stain, in vitro and by preparing histological samples from implants retrieved from immunodeficient (SCID) mice, where cementoblasts were treated with EMD prior to implantation. EMD promoted proliferation of all cell types. EMD down-regulated osteocalcin transcripts in cementoblasts and MC3T3-E1 cells and up-regulated osteopontin gene expression markedly in MC3T3-E1 cells and slightly in cementoblasts at day 8. In vitro, EMD decreased cementoblast-mediated biomineralization. In contrast, mineralization was noted in implants retrieved from SCID mice, where cells were pretreated with EMD.","These results indicate that EMD can influence activities of cementoblasts and osteoblasts, and thus may be able to regulate cell activities at a periodontal regenerative site.",closed_qa
Does optical coherence tomography indicate disease activity prior to clinical onset of central nervous system demyelination?,"Establishing biomarkers for predicting disease activity in demyelinating disease of the central nervous system is crucial for designing appropriate disease modifiying treatment strategies. To investigate retinal findings and disease activity in patients with radiologically isolated and clinically isolated syndromes. We performed retinal optical coherence tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in healthy control individuals (n=19), in individuals with non-specific white matter lesions (n=18), and in patients with clinically isolated syndromes (n=18) and radiologically isolated syndromes (n=20). Reduced volume of retinal nerve fibre layer and increased volume of inner nuclear layer at baseline correlated with subsequent disease activity as measured by an increase in cerebral T2 lesion load in patients with radiologically isolated syndromes. Reduced volume of retinal nerve fibre layer and increased volumes of inner and outer nuclear layer were associated with progression into multiple sclerosis in patients with clinically isolated syndromes.","Patients with radiologically and clinically isolated syndromes behave similarly concerning paraclinical disease activity in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. In both conditions, reduction of retinal nerve fibre layer and increased inner nuclear layer and outer nuclear layer volumes predict disease activity and are associated with progression into multiple sclerosis.",closed_qa
Does the role of needle tip position on the accuracy of diagnostic selective nerve root block in spinal deformity?,"The specificity of a selective nerve root block (SNRB) is dependant on isolating only the required nerve root whilst avoiding injectate flow to traversing nerves. Needle tip position is therefore crucial. Nerve root blocks (SNRBs) in the presence of deformity can be particularly technically challenging to perform. The aims of this study were to document the relationship of needle tip position and SNRB accuracy in patients with and without spinal deformity. Over an 8-month period, all SNRBs performed by one spinal surgeon were included. Patients with radiographic evidence of spinal deformity were analysed separately and their lumbar deformity graded using the Schwab grading system. Needle tip position in relation to the superior pedicle and flow of contrast was documented. 76 patients received 85 injections without deformity, 26 patients with deformity underwent 30 SNRBs. In the normal spinal alignment group, there was on overall accuracy of 70.1% regardless of needle tip position, which improved to 91.8% for a lateral needle tip position (P < 0.001). In patients with deformity, the overall accuracy was significantly lower irrespective of needle tip position 36 versus 70%, respectively (P < 0.0019).",Selective nerve root blocks are accurate in patients without deformity where a needle tip placement lateral to the middle third of the pedicle is achieved. The presence of spinal deformity significantly reduces the accuracy of SNRBs with a higher chance of epidural infiltration.,closed_qa
Are dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry regional estimates associated with visceral adipose tissue mass?,"Recent studies support the possibility of estimating abdominal fat using a region of interest (ROI) selected by conventional whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This is an important observation as DXA ROI estimates have some advantages over waist circumference or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a means of assessing visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and adipose tissue distribution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of DXA abdominal ROI estimates in assessing VAT among non-obese men. Observational, cross-sectional study comparing correlations between MRI-measured total VAT and surrogate measures including DXA ROIs. A stepwise multiple regression model was applied to derive a predictive equation with total VAT mass. Ninety non-obese healthy men between the ages of 18 and 44 y with BMI<30 kg/m(2). Abdominal adipose tissue and total VAT were measured by whole body MRI; VAT area by single-slice MRI at the L4-5 level; specific DXA ROIs for abdominal regional fat defined as ROI A (L2-4), B (L2-upper iliac), C (lower costal-upper iliac), and D (ROI C excluding spine); and simple anthropometric measures. Correlations between total VAT and ROIs A (r=0.85) and B (r=0.84) were not significantly different from that of VAT area at L4-5 (r=0.87), but significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of waist circumference (r=0.77). The highest correlations with total abdominal adipose tissue were for DXA ROIs and conventional DXA trunk fat (r=0.95-0.97). A stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that 86% of the variance in total VAT was predicted by VAT area at L4-5, ROI A, and waist-hip ratio.","DXA ROIs (L2-4, L2-upper iliac) were associated with total VAT as well as MRI-derived VAT area at L4-5 in non-obese men.

Intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated unilaterally in Wistar rats with argon laser irradiation of the trabecular meshwork 5 days after intracameral injection of india ink. Immunohistochemical staining for Hsp72 was performed. The rats with elevated IOP were treated with heat stress once a week (six rats) or intraperitoneal injection of zinc (10 mg/kg) every two weeks (six rats). Untreated rats with elevated IOP served as a control group (six rats). Quercetin, an inhibitor of Hsp expression was injected in the rats with heat stress (six rats) and zinc injection (seven rats). Subsequent to 4 weeks of IOP elevation, RGCs were counted. The IOP increase compared with the contralateral eyes was 48% +/- 4% throughout the study period. Hsp72 was detected only in the eyes with elevated IOP at 1 and 2 days and was weakly detected at 1 week of IOP elevation. A single administration of zinc strongly induced Hsp72 in RGCs of rats with elevated IOP for 2 weeks. Treatment with heat stress or zinc in rats with elevated IOP increased RGC survival after 4 weeks of IOP elevation, compared with the untreated control group (P = 0.004, n = 6). Quercetin reversed the positive effect of heat stress or zinc injection on RGC survival.",These results demonstrate the possibility of a novel therapeutic approach to glaucoma through an enhanced induction of the endogenous heat shock response.,closed_qa
Does endurance training affect IGF-1/IGFBP-3 and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes?,"Twenty male patients with T2D voluntarily participated in this study and were randomly divided into two groups: the training group (N.=10) and the control group (N.=10). The training protocol consisted of a 45-minutes cycling session/day, three days/week for six weeks with intensity 60-70% of the maximum heart rate. To examine the IGF-1 and the IGFBP-3, fasting blood glucose levels, and insulin resistance, blood sampling was performed before and immediately after the first and 18th sessions. The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) method was used to determine insulin resistance. Before the study began, no significant difference between the two groups was observed in the anthropometric and blood factors. After a session of aerobic exercise, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were significantly increased (153.79% and 64.3%, respectively), and fasting glucose and insulin resistance levels were significantly decreased (15.82% and 27.82%, respectively); however, the changes resulting from a six-week training period were not significant.","According to the present study, one session of aerobic exercise for middle-aged men with T2D leads to increased IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, and to decreased fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Considering the lack of changes after a six-week training, it seems that the amount of change depends on subjects' fitness level and exercise parameters. From a clinical point of view, the beneficial effects of acute exercise inT2D subjects show that such exercises should be part of the daily program for them.",closed_qa
"Glutamine synthetase in cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and brain: a diagnostic marker for Alzheimer disease?","To determine whether the glutamine synthetase (GS) level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a useful biochemical marker in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), and to assess the source of GS (brain vs. blood derived) in CSF. Sandwich enzyme immunoassay and immunoblotting were applied to detect GS in CSF and in serum from neurologically healthy control subjects and patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The origin of GS was estimated by the concentration gradients of CSF to serum and ventricular to lumbar CSF. In addition, postmortem brain tissue from controls and patients with AD was analyzed using immunohistochemistry for expression of GS. Levels of GS were significantly increased in lumbar CSF from patients with AD (20+/-12 pg/mL; P = .01) and to a lesser extent in patients with vascular dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In CSF of controls, GS levels were 4+/-3 pg/mL. The GS concentration gradients were less than 1:10 for CSF to serum and 2:1 for ventricular to lumbar CSF. Immunoreactivity of GS was most prominent in astrocytes from temporal neocortex of patients with AD, suggesting a relationship between astrocyte reactions and increased GS levels in CSF.","Level of GS in lumbar CSF of patients with AD is increased significantly but nonspecifically, probably related to the strong astrogliosis in brain. Glutamine synthetase in lumbar CSF is mainly brain derived.",closed_qa
Is risk of nephrolithiasis in primary hyperparathyroidism associated with two polymorphisms of the calcium-sensing receptor gene?,"Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene were previously associated with kidney stones in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT): rs1501899, likely associated with a decrease in CASR expression, and Arg990Gly, causing a gain of CASR function. To evaluate the interaction of these two SNPs in the stone risk, we tested the association of stones with the genotype at both SNPs in PHPT patients and the association of rs1501899 with CASR expression as messenger RNA (mRNA) in human kidney samples. Two hundred and ninety-six PHPT patients were genotyped at the rs1501899 and Arg990Gly SNPs. Minor allele frequency at tested SNPs was higher in PHPT stone formers relative to non-stone forming patients. PHPT patients carrying one or two copies of the minor allele at both rs1501899 and Arg990Gly (n = 16) had the maximal risk of stones (odds ratio, OR 8.3) and higher serum ionized calcium compared with homozygous patients for the wild-type allele at both SNPs. CASR expression as mRNA was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in normal kidney medulla samples from 109 subjects. CASR mRNA was significantly lower in medulla samples from homozygotes for the minor allele at rs1501899 than in subjects with other genotypes.","We conclude that the simultaneous presence of the minor allele at rs1501899 and Arg990Gly may amplify the kidney stone risk in PHPT patients, despite their apparently opposite effects on CASR function in the kidney.",closed_qa
Is confident commitment a key factor for sustained breastfeeding?,"The characteristics that distinguish women who breastfeed successfully from those who do not are just beginning to be identified in breastfeeding literature. The objective of this study was to identify the processes contributing to breastfeeding decisions among Caucasian and African American women. Data were initially collected through 24 focus groups consisting of separate groups of African American and Caucasian pregnant women, and breastfeeding and formula-feeding mothers from three major United States cities. The focus group study was initiated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to obtain data on salient messages that would inform a national campaign to promote breastfeeding. This study was a secondary analysis of those data using a modified grounded theory approach. The process that emerged associated with successful breastfeeding was labeled ""confident commitment."" This process included several components: a) confidence in the process of breastfeeding, b) confidence in their ability to breastfeed, and c) commitment to making breastfeeding work despite obstacles.","Contrary to popular conceptions, breastfeeding appears to be a learned skill. If mothers achieved a level of ""confident commitment"" before the birth, they were able to withstand lack of support by significant others and common challenges that occurred as they initiated breastfeeding. Without the element of ""confident commitment,"" a decision to breastfeed appeared to fall apart once challenged.",closed_qa
Do pediatric trauma centers have better survival rates than adult trauma centers?,"Pediatric trauma centers (PTCs) were developed to improve the survival of injured children, but it is currently unknown if children admitted to PTCs are more likely to survive than those admitted to adult trauma centers (ATCs). Fifty-three thousand one hundred thirteen pediatric trauma cases from 22 PTCs and 31 ATCs included in the National Pediatric Trauma Registry were reviewed to evaluate survival rates at PTCs and ATCs. Overall, 1,259 children died. The raw mortality rate was lower at PTCs (1.81% of 32,554 children) than at ATCs (3.88% of 18,368 children). However, patients admitted to ATCs were more severely injured. When Injury Severity Score, Pediatric Trauma Score, mechanism (blunt or penetrating), gender, age, clustering, and American College of Surgeons (ACS) verification status were controlled for using a single logistic regression model, there was no statistically significant difference in survival between PTCs and ATCs (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.26; p = 0.587). A similar comparison of the 12 ACS-verified trauma centers with the 41 nonverified centers showed verification to be associated with improved survival (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.97; p = 0.013).","Although PTCs have higher overall survival rates than ATCs, this difference disappears when the analysis controls for Injury Severity Score, Pediatric Trauma Score, age, mechanism, and ACS verification status. ACS-verified centers have significantly higher survival rates than do unverified centers.",closed_qa
Does ginsenoside Rg3 prevent INS-1 cell death from intermittent high glucose stress?,"Ginsenoside Rg3 has been proposed to mediate anti-diabetic effects, but their direct effect on pancreatic β cell viability and mechanisms are not clearly understood. Recent studies suggest that intermittent high glucose (IHG) could be more harmful to pancreatic β cells than sustained high glucose. There are few reports about the effect of the ginsenosideRg3 to β cell apoptosis and proliferation against IHG. INS-1 cells were treated with alternative glucose concentration with or without ginsenoside Rg3. Cell apoptosis and viability were detected by Annexin V staining and MTT assay. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Quantification of secreted insulin protein was measured using rat/mouse Insulin ELISA kits. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining and florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed to compare cell proliferation. INS-1 cell viability was decreased under IHG and increased with Rg3 treatment.Rg3 significantly reduced the apoptotic INS-1 cells against IHG. The quantification of secreted insulin concentration was increased with Rg3. Rg3 increased INS-1 cell proliferation. ERK and p38 MAPK pathways reduced by IHG were activated by the ginsenoside Rg3.",Ginsenoside Rg3 protected INS-1 cell death from IHG with reducing apoptosis and increasing proliferation.,closed_qa
Does training improve interobserver reliability for the diagnosis of scaphoid fracture displacement?,"The diagnosis of displacement in scaphoid fractures is notorious for poor interobserver reliability. We tested whether training can improve interobserver reliability and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the diagnosis of scaphoid fracture displacement on radiographs and CT scans. Sixty-four orthopaedic surgeons rated a set of radiographs and CT scans of 10 displaced and 10 nondisplaced scaphoid fractures for the presence of displacement, using a web-based rating application. Before rating, observers were randomized to a training group (34 observers) and a nontraining group (30 observers). The training group received an online training module before the rating session, and the nontraining group did not. Interobserver reliability for training and nontraining was assessed by Siegel's multirater kappa and the Z-test was used to test for significance. There was a small, but significant difference in the interobserver reliability for displacement ratings in favor of the training group compared with the nontraining group. Ratings of radiographs and CT scans combined resulted in moderate agreement for both groups. The average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diagnosing displacement of scaphoid fractures were, respectively, 83%, 85%, and 84% for the nontraining group and 87%, 86%, and 87% for the training group. Assuming a 5% prevalence of fracture displacement, the positive predictive value was 0.23 in the nontraining group and 0.25 in the training group. The negative predictive value was 0.99 in both groups.","Our results suggest training can improve interobserver reliability and sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the diagnosis of scaphoid fracture displacement, but the improvements are slight. These findings are encouraging for future research regarding interobserver variation and how to reduce it further.",closed_qa
