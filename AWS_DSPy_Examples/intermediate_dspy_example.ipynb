    "### Use DSPy with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy, developed by Stanford NLP, is an open-source library designed to streamline the process of creating and managing data science workflows. It is built around three core components: Signatures, Modules, and Optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signatures**: Declarative specs of input/ output behavior of a module. This cleanly segregates what we want the module to do from how to do it. You provide some description of the fields (which will be used to build prompt) and field names carry semantic meaning as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modules**: This is the core part of the program that manages the flow logic. DSPy provides built-in modules for basic Predict, Chain of Thought, ReAct, etc. You can create your own and compose multiple modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimizers**: The framework provides few optimizers(e.g. LabeledFewShot, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearc etc.) that tune prompt (adds examples based on random selection) and model parameters (e.g. temperature). They evaluate the performance based on the metric to optimize\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compiler**: Optimizes the instructions of Module and get relevant/ efficient examples for the task. The compiled program can be saved to disk and reloaded similar to checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**: DSPy aims to address the challenges of programming with language models by providing similar building blocks. It offers a composable pattern to represent individual units. DSPy doesn’t eliminate language prompts altogether; instead, it builds the prompts based on the signatures, hints, and target models. DSPy helps crystallize our focus on writing the core logic along with signature field annotations and hints, rather than constructing lengthy prompts from scratch._"

How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to Okay, let's think through this step-by-step. Question: Rookie police officers have to buy duty shoes at the full price of $85, but officers who have served at least a year get a 20% discount. Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes? Reasoning: Let's think step-by-step in order to calculate the final price. 1. The full price of the shoes is $85. 2. Officers who have served at least a year get a 20% discount. * 20% of $85 is $17 * $85 - $17 = $68 3. Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. * 25% of $68 is $17 * $68 - $17 = $51 Therefore, an officer who has served at least three years has to pay $51 for the shoes.\\nAnswer: $51\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: The average score on last week's Spanish test was 90.

Marco scored 10% less than the average test score and Margaret received 5 more points than Marco. What score did Margaret receive on her test? Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that: - The average score on the Spanish test was 90. - Marco scored 10% less than the average test score. - Margaret received 5 more points than Marco. First, let's calculate Marco's score: - 10% less than 90 is 90 - (90 * 0.1) = 81. Now, let's calculate Margaret's score: - Margaret received 5 more points than Marco, so her score is 81 + 5 = 86.\\nAnswer: Margaret received a score of 86 on the Spanish test.\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Nancy bought a pie sliced it into 8 pieces.

She gave 1/2 to Joe and Darcy, and she gave 1/4 to Carl. How many slices were left? Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. * The pie was sliced into 8 pieces * Nancy gave 1/2 of the pie to Joe and Darcy, which is 4 slices * Nancy gave 1/4 of the pie to Carl, which is 2 slices * So the total number of slices given away is 4 + 2 = 6 slices * The original pie had 8 slices, so the number of slices left is 8 - 6 = 2 slices\\nAnswer: 2 slices were left.\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts.

The bike costs $112.\\n2. Trey plans to sell bracelets for $1 each over the next two weeks (14 days).\\n3. To calculate the total number of bracelets he needs to sell, we divide the cost of the bike ($112) by the price of each bracelet ($1):\\n   * $112 / $1 = 112 bracelets\\n4. To find the average number of bracelets he needs to sell each day, we divide the total number of bracelets (112) by the number of days (14):\\n   * 112 bracelets / 14 days = 8 bracelets per day\\n\\nTherefore, on average, Trey needs to sell 8 bracelets each day to raise enough money for the $112 bike.\\n\\nAnswer: Trey needs to sell an average of 8 bracelets each day.\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n\""

      "    rationale=\"Question: Write a simple python function to calculate the first five items in the Fibonacci sequence.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the code. We need to define a function that takes no arguments and returns a list containing the first five Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. We can use a loop to calculate the next number in the sequence by summing the previous two numbers, and append it to a list until we have the desired number of elements.\",\n",

We define a function `fibonacci()`.\\n2. We initialize a list `fib_list` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate from 3 to 5 (range stops at 6, but doesn't include it).\\n4. Inside the loop, we calculate the next Fibonacci number by summing the previous two numbers in the list using their indices (`fib_list[i-2]` and `fib_list[i-3]`).\\n5. We append the new number to the `fib_list`.\\n6. After the loop finishes, we return the `fib_list` containing the first five Fibonacci numbers.\\n\\nTo use the function, you can call it like this:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = fibonacci()\\nprint(result)  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\\n```\"\n",
