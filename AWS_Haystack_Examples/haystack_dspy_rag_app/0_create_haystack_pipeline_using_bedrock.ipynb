    "## Create a Haystack RAG pipeline using Amazon Bedrock - Part 1\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Haystack is an open-source framework by deepset that allows developers to orchestrate LLM applications made up of different components like models, vector DBs, file converters, and countless other modules. Haystack provides pipelines and Agents, two powerful structures for designing LLM applications for various use cases including search, question answering, and conversational AI. With a big focus on state-of-the art retrieval methods and solid evaluation metrics, it provides you with everything you need to ship a reliable, trustworthy application. You can serialize pipelines to YAML files, expose them via a REST API, and scale them flexibly with your workloads, making it easy to move your application from a prototype stage to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook series, we will use Amazon Bedrock as a `DocumentTextEmbedder`, `TextEmbedder` and `Generator`. We will use the `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` as our choice of embeddings model and `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0` as our choice of generator model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will do as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a standard RAG pipeline on Haystack. We will use the `vblagoje/PubMedQA_instruction` dataset from where we will load documents in the InMemoryDataStore.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embed the document and connect it to a writer, and write `1000` rows of this dataset to the `InMemoryDocumentStore` using `cosine` as the `embedding_similarity_function`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a RAG Anthropic Claude prompt template and use it in the prompt builder. We will also create an `AmazonBedrockGenerator` and use a `InMemoryBM25Retriever` as the retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lastly, we will connect all of these components into a single pipeline, serialize the pipeline and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the pipeline is saved, we can load it in the next notebook and run inferences, and evaluate some of the responses."
