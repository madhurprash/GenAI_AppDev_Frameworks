This paper presents a comprehensive survey of KD\\'s role in imparting advanced knowledge.\\n\\nAbstract —In the era of Large Language Models, Knowledge Distillation emerges as a pivotal methodology for transferring advanced capabilities from proprietary LLMs to open-source counterparts, facilitating their self-improvement by employing themselves as teachers.\\nxamined through a meticulous survey that delves into the foundational pillars of algorithm, skill, and verticalization, which form the backbone of knowledge distillation and deep learning models. The survey provides a comprehensive examination of key mechanisms within the knowledge distillation framework, specifically focusing on the enhancement of cognitive abilities and their practical implications across various fields, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between data augmentation (DA) and knowledge distillation.\\nen-source LLMs, this survey highlights the potential for more accessible, efficient, and powerful AI solutions.\\n\\nMost importantly, we advocate for compliance with legal terms that regulate the use of LLMs, ensuring ethical and lawful application of knowledge distillation.\\n\\nAn associated Github repository is available at https://github.com/Tebmer/Awesome-Knowledge-Distillation-of-LLMs. Index Terms - Large language models, knowledge distillation, data augmentation, skill distillation, supervised fine-tuning\\nsophisticated problem-solving capabilities, the core significance of these large language models (LLMs) lies in their emergent abilities, enabling them to tackle a diverse array of tasks with remarkable proficiency.\\ntheir remarkable capabilities, have some notable limitations, particularly when considering the advantages offered by open-source models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini. These models are often expensive, with substantial usage fees and restricted access, making them inaccessible to individuals and smaller organizations.\\nng restrictions and costs. In contrast, open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Mistral bring several advantages. Accessibility and adaptability are key benefits, as they are more readily available to a broader range of users, including researchers and organizations.\\nts. One of the most significant limitations is the smaller model scale, resulting in lower performance on real-world tasks with multiple instructions (Zheng et al., 2023a). Models with fewer parameters struggle to capture the depth and breadth of knowledge embodied in larger models like GPT-4. Additionally, the pre-training investment in these open-source models is typically less substantial. This reduced investment can lead to a narrower range of pre-training data, potentially limiting their understanding and handling of diverse or specialized topics (Liang et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024a). Fine-tuning steps are often fewer due to resource constraints, hindering model optimization for specific tasks or industries.\\nary models becomes apparent when compared to highly fine-tuned proprietary LLMs. Primarily, the disparity between proprietary and open-source LLMs becomes evident, with proprietary models excelling in complex scenarios, while open-source models excel in a wide range of scenarios. Knowledge distillation, a technique that leverages the advanced capabilities of proprietary models, is used to enhance the competencies of open-source models. This process is similar to transferring the performance of a skilled teacher to a student.\\ntillation of LLMs, where a small seed of knowledge is used to prompt the LLM to generate more data with respect to a specific skill or domain (Taori et al., 2023). Furthermore, KD retains its fundamental role in compressing LLMs, making them more efficient without significant loss in performance.\\nadvanced context following and instruction following**\\n\\n**key aspects of knowledge distillation**\\n\\n* **contextual understanding**: in-context learning and instruction following\\n* **alignment with user intents**: human values/principles and thinking patterns like chain-of-thought\\n* **NLP task specialization**: semantic understanding and code generation\\n\\n**critical skills for various applications**\\n\\n* **healthcare**: accuracy and contextual knowledge\\n* **law**: contextual knowledge and precision\\n* **science**: contextual knowledge and precision\\nned in the era of LLMs, the benefits of knowledge distillation in the era of LLMs are multifaceted and transformative. Through a suite of distillation techniques, the gap between proprietary and open-source models narrows and is filled. This process streamlines computational requirements and enhances environmental sustainability of AI operations, as open-source models become more proficient with lower overhead.\\nch domains. The escalating need for a comprehensive survey on the knowledge distillation of LLMs stems from the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and the increasing complexity of these models. The ability to efficiently and effectively distill knowledge from proprietary LLMs to open-source ones becomes a practical necessity. This is driven by the need to bridge the knowledge gap between the proprietary and open-source LLMs.\\n\\nThis need is driven by the 3 models mentioned, including Student, Vicuna, Opt, GPT, and others. These models are being used in various sectors such as law, healthcare, finance, and science, and the ability to distill knowledge from them is becoming increasingly important.\\nsynthesizefeedbackFeedback input outputSelf-Knowledge outputinputinput YlabelLabelingExpansion X,Y demonstrationsexpandFeature featureinput,outputextractSec.4Sec.5 Sec.3.1Sec.3.2 Fig. 2: An overview of this survey on knowledge distillation of large language models\\nes emerging, but there is still much to be learned from the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this section, we provide a foundational overview of knowledge distillation, highlighting the role of data augmentation (DA) in this context.\\n\\nTraditional techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning, have shown promise in distilling knowledge from LLMs. However, the increasing complexity of these models requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resources. To further explore the possibilities of knowledge distillation, we examine methods involving supervised fine-tuning, such as incremental learning and transfer learning.\\n\\nSupervised fine-tuning involves training a model on a smaller dataset with the goal of adapting to a specific task or domain. This approach has shown significant improvement in various NLP tasks, but may not be scalable to large-scale applications. In contrast, transfer learning offers a more flexible approach, where a model is trained on a smaller dataset and then fine-tuned on a larger dataset. This can lead to improved performance on a variety of tasks, but requires careful selection of the target dataset.\\n\\nAnother approach is divergence and similarity, which involve exploring the differences and similarities between the knowledge distillation process and traditional machine learning. Reinforcement learning and ranking optimization are also gaining attention, particularly in the context of knowledge distillation, where the goal is to optimize the distillation process itself. These methods can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge distillation, but require careful consideration of the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.\\n\\nSkill distillation focuses on enhancing student models to improve their understanding of the task and their ability to perform well on NLP tasks. This can be achieved through various methods, including data augmentation, feature learning, and attention mechanisms. By incorporating these techniques, student models can better understand the context and intentions of the user, leading to improved performance across a variety of tasks.\\n\\nWe propose several strategies for skill distillation, including:\\nmmendation systems, and the evaluation of text generation. In §5, we delve into domain-specific vertical distillation, demonstrating how knowledge distillation techniques are applied in specialized fields such as law, healthcare, finance, and science, highlighting their practical implications and transformative impact.

In this context, distillation refers to the process of distilling the knowledge from a larger model into a smaller model, allowing it to learn from the teacher model\\'s output.\\n\\nThe current era of knowledge distillation in large language models (LLMs) has shifted the focus from mere architecture compression to a more nuanced process of knowledge elicitation and transfer. This paradigm change is largely due to the immense knowledge that LLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini possess. The parameters of LLMs make it challenging to compress them using pruning or quantization techniques.\\nsize, the current focus in llm-based knowledge distillation is to extract and transfer the rich, nuanced understanding that these models have developed the key to this modern approach lies in carefully designed prompts that elicit specific knowledge or capabilities from the llms, tapping into their understanding and capabilities in various domains ranging from natural language understanding to more complex cognitive tasks like reasoning and problem-solving\\nexplicit training objectives. This era of knowledge distillation also emphasizes the transfer of abstract qualities such as reasoning patterns and preference alignment. This is in stark contrast to the earlier focus on output replication, indicating a shift towards a more holistic and comprehensive transfer of cognitive capabilities. The current techniques involve not just the replication of outputs, but also the emulation of thought processes and decision-making patterns of the teacher model. This involves complex strategies like chain-of-thought prompting, where the student model learns the reasoning process of the teacher, enhancing its problem-solving and decision-making capabilities. 2.2 Relation to Data Augmentation (DA)\\nllation, Unlike traditional techniques such as paraphrasing, or back-translation, which primarily aim at expanding the training dataset in a somewhat mechanical manner. DA within the context of LLMs focuses on the generation of novel, context-rich training data tailored to specific domains and skills. This innovation is driven by the unique capabilities of LLMs to generate coherent, diverse, and intricate data samples that closely mimic the nuanced understanding and cognitive abilities of human experts in various fields.\\nource models, through Deep Learning Models (LLMs) are prompted to create targeted, high-quality datasets that are not merely larger in volume but also rich in diversity and specificity. This approach enables the distillation process to be more effective, ensuring that the distilled models replicate the teacher model\\'s output behavior and embody its deep-seated understanding and cognitive strategies. The significance and necessity of Data Augmentation (DA) for achieving Knowledge Domains (KD) in the LLM era cannot be overstated. DA acts as a force multiplier, enabling the distilled models to acquire and refine capabilities that would otherwise require exponentially larger datasets and computational resources. It facilitates a more nuanced and effective transfer of knowledge, focusing on the qualitative aspects of learning rather than quantitative expansion.\\ner of LLMs empowers open-source models with the ability to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment, and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts thereby democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities and fostering innovation across a broader spectrum of applications and users 2 3 Survey Scope Building on the discussions introduced earlier this survey aims to comprehensively explore the landscape of knowledge distillation within the context of LLMs following a meticulously structured taxonomy as in Figure 3 the survey’s scope is delineated through three primary facets each encapsulating a range of subtopics and methodologies\\nundations and methodologies of knowledge distillation. It includes an in-depth exploration of processes involved in constructing knowledge from teacher models (e.g., proprietary LLMs) and integrating this knowledge into student models (e.g., open-source LLMs). Under the umbrella of \\'knowledge\\', we delve into strategies such as labeling, expansion, curation, feature understanding, and feedback mechanisms. The exploration seeks to uncover the various ways in which knowledge can be identified, expanded, and curated for effective distillation. This subsection examines learning approaches like supervised fine-tuning, divergence minimization, and reinforcement learning techniques.\\now algorithms enable knowledge transfer, allowing open-source models to replicate and sometimes surpass proprietary capabilities. Skill Distillation examines specific competencies and capabilities enhanced through Knowledge Distillation. Contextual discussions follow (Taori et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023c), including instruction following and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. Alignment research investigates thinking patterns, persona/preference modeling, and value alignment. The \\'agent\\' category focuses on skills like tool usage and planning. NLP task specialization (Dai et al., 2023a; Jung et al., 2023; Chaudhary, 2023) is examined through lenses like natural language understanding (NLU), natural language processing (NLP).\\ntion, and Code Generation**\\n\\nFinally, the survey explores how Knowledge Distillation (KD) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting and integrating multiple forms of input, enriching their utility and applicability across various contexts. Verticalization Distillation\\nThis section examines the application of KD across diverse domains, providing insights into how distilled LLMs can be tailored for specialized fields such as Law, Medical & Healthcare (Wang et al., 2023a), Finance (Zhang and Yang, 2023), Science (Zhang et al., 2024), among others. This exploration showcases the practical implications of KD techniques and highlights their transformative impact on domain-specific AI solutions. Through detailed analysis and examples, this part aims to demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of KD in adapting LLMs to diverse domains.\\nstem. by navigating through these facets, this survey endeavors to provide an extensive and nuanced analysis of knowledge distillation in the era of LLMs. it serves as a guide for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts in the field, shedding light on current methodologies, challenges, and opportunities for innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.\\nacross a range of applications.\\n\\nDistillation Pipeline in LLM Era\\n'"

      "Welcome to \"The Knowledge Distillation Podcast\"! I'm your host, [Speaker 1], and I'll be guiding you through the fascinating world of Knowledge Distillation, a methodology that's revolutionizing the way we transfer advanced capabilities from proprietary Large Language Models to their open-source counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we're joined by [Speaker 2], who's new to this topic, and we're excited to explore the ins and outs of Knowledge Distillation together.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: So, let's start with the basics. Knowledge Distillation is a technique that enables us to transfer knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, more efficient model. Can you tell me, [Speaker 2], what you think is the most exciting aspect of Knowledge Distillation?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: Umm, I think it's the idea that we can take these massive models and distill them down to something more manageable, while still retaining the key information. It's like, we're trying to capture the essence of a fine wine and put it into a smaller bottle. (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: (laughs) That's a great analogy! And you're right, the goal is to preserve the knowledge and capabilities of the larger model while making it more accessible and efficient. One of the key techniques used in Knowledge Distillation is called \"soft target training.\" Can you tell me, [Speaker 2], what you think that means?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Is it like, when we're training the student model, we're using the teacher model's output as a target, but we're not just copying it exactly? We're trying to get the student model to learn the underlying patterns and relationships?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: That's absolutely right! Soft target training is a way of training the student model to learn from the teacher model's output, but in a way that's more nuanced and flexible. We're not just trying to replicate the output exactly, but rather capture the underlying knowledge and reasoning patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: That makes sense. And I'm curious, how does Data Augmentation fit into this process?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: Ah, great question! Data Augmentation is a crucial component of Knowledge Distillation. In the context of LLMs, Data Augmentation involves generating new, high-quality training data that's tailored to specific domains and skills. This enables the distillation process to be more effective, as the student model can learn from a more diverse and representative dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: Hmm, I see. So, it's like, we're not just relying on the existing data, but we're actively generating new data that's specifically designed to help the student model learn?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: Exactly! And this is where LLMs come in – they have the ability to generate coherent, diverse, and intricate data samples that closely mimic the nuanced understanding and cognitive abilities of human experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: Wow, that's amazing. And I'm curious, how does this impact the way we approach AI development?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: Well, with Knowledge Distillation, we're democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. By distilling knowledge from proprietary models into open-source models, we're enabling a wider range of users to access and utilize these capabilities. This has the potential to drive innovation and progress across a broad spectrum of applications and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: That's incredible. And I have to ask, what's the most exciting application of Knowledge Distillation that you've seen?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: Ah, that's a tough one! But I think one of the most promising areas is in the field of natural language processing. By distilling knowledge from large language models, we can create more efficient and effective language models that can be used in a wide range of applications, from language translation to text summarization.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: That's amazing. And I'm curious, what are some of the challenges that we face in implementing Knowledge Distillation?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: Well, one of the biggest challenges is the complexity of the distillation process. It requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resources. Additionally, there's the challenge of evaluating the effectiveness of the distillation process – how do we measure the success of the student model?\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 2]: Hmm, that's a great point. And I'm sure there are many more challenges that we haven't even touched on yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Speaker 1]: Absolutely! But despite the challenges, the potential benefits of Knowledge Distillation make it an area of research that's well worth exploring. And that's why we're excited to delve deeper into this topic and explore the many facets of Knowledge Distillation.\n",
