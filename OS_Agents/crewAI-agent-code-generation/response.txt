The User's goal is to generate Python code for uploading a file to S3. (2) The information provided includes the requirement for using the "amazon.nova-micro-v1:0" model for code generation. (3) To fulfill the User's request, I need to use the POST__<REDACTED>__<REDACTED> tool with the provided problem statement and model ID. (4) The action plan is complete as it involves generating the code using the specified tool and parameters. (5) The next step is to execute the POST__<REDACTED>__<REDACTED> tool with the given problem statement and model ID. (6) The action requires the problem statement "upload file on s3" and the model ID "amazon.nova-micro-v1:0". (7) I have everything I need to execute the next step. Here is the Python code to upload a file to an S3 bucket using the boto3 library: ```python import boto3 from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError def upload_file_to_s3(file_path, bucket_name, object_name=None): """ Upload a file to an S3 bucket :param file_path: File to upload :param bucket_name: S3 bucket name :param object_name: S3 object name. If not specified then file_name is used :return: True if file was uploaded, else False """ # Initialize the S3 client s3_client = boto3.client('s3') # If the S3 object_name was not specified, use the file_name if object_name is None: object_name = file_path try: # Upload the file s3_client.upload_file(file_path, bucket_name, object_name) return True except FileNotFoundError: print("The file was not found") return False except NoCredentialsError: print("Credentials not available") return False except PartialCredentialsError: print("Incomplete credentials provided") return False except Exception as e: print(f"An error occurred: {e}") return False def main(): # Configuration parameters file_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt' # Path to the file you want to upload bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name' # S3 bucket name # Upload the file to S3 if upload_file_to_s3(file_path, bucket_name): print("File uploaded successfully") else: print("File upload failed") if __name__ == "__main__": main() ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Initialization**: The S3 client is initialized using `boto3.client('s3')`. 2. **File Upload**: The `upload_file` method of the S3 client is used to upload the file. 3. **Error Handling**: Various exceptions are handled to ensure the program doesn't crash due to missing files, credentials, or other issues. 4. **Main Function**: The `main` function sets the file path and bucket name and calls the `upload_file_to_s3` function. 5. **Entry Point**: The script checks if it's being run directly and calls the `main` function. Replace `'path/to/your/file.txt'` with the path to the file you want to upload and `'your-bucket-name'` with the name of your S3 bucket. Make sure your AWS credentials are properly configured in your environment.
