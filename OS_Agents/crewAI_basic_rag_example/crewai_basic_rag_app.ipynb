    "CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CrewAI has the following main components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Crew`: This is the top level management system that manages various AI teams, breaks down simple tasks and delegates those tasks, ensures collaboration between the agents and ensures task completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `AI Agents`: These are specialized entities (agents), could be a writer, researcher, etc. These agents have the power to make autonomous decisions and perform certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Process`: This is the workflow that defines the collaboration patterns between the sub agents, controls the task assignments, interactions and task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Tasks`: These are well-defined micro-level tasks that are supposed to be executed by the AI agent to produce some level of actionable result."
